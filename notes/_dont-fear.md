- Anton joins "Food not bombs"
- X goes is in love with a friend of Yana's
- 

I realized I was going crazy just looking at Anton, as if every pore of his skin had turned into a miniature mouth that constantly spat on everything and everyone who had ever set foot on this planet. He believed only in himself, couldn't tolerate anyone else's opinion, and the worst part was that what he said really sounded logical. The nasty brat... Even if he spoke the biggest and most unheard-of nonsense, for some reason when I was with him, it sounded super logical to me.

"Okay, and where exactly does she live?"

Pay more attention to details.
{: .note}

From there, we threw out the old dirty oilcloth that covered the table, and in its place put a clean white tablecloth. The Curious One stepped back a little, looked over the new arrangement, and satisfied with the result, went to prepare the food—he took a few potatoes out of the fridge, cut them without peeling them, and put them in the fryer. He also took two chicken cutlets, which had previously been swimming in a large pot with marinade.

The two of us started setting the table: we spread the tablecloth and began arranging plates and glasses. We also took out the silverware that had been sitting in the sideboard of said dining room ever since we moved in here. I made a trip to the fridge and came back with some semi-finished dessert, which I placed in the middle of the table. Anton immediately went to the silverware drawer and returned with two small dessert spoons. This gesture inspired him and he headed to the living room, from where he returned with an unfinished bottle of white wine (at least that doesn't go bad). For it, we washed two glasses with stems, which we also found in the sideboard, and placed each of these items carefully, as if preparing a movie set. When we finished, the cutlets and fries were just done, so I poured them onto plates and sat at the table, waiting for Anton to follow. He, however, was staring at the ceiling and wandering aimlessly around the room. I called him several times, but he didn't answer. I could already sense he was pondering something. I didn't want to bother him, so I decided to wait a little more...
"You know what?" He finally said. "However dangerous it is, I want to go back there. To see what Bonchev saw."
"Isn't it too late?"
"We can get there in half an hour. How does that sound to you?"
"I don't know what to tell you, friend..."
"Come on, don't explain." He said. "We'll eat when we get back."

In ten minutes, we reached the neighborhood where the man lived again. Anton got out of the car while it was still moving and walked with quick steps towards the entrance, mumbling something under his nose:
"What did he say?" I asked.
"I was wondering, after all, what was so damn scary, for God's sake?"

The light on the staircase was burnt out. We waited for it to go off, and headed to the apartment, lighting the way with our phone screens. We reached the apartment. Slowly we opened the door, preparing to run if we encountered someone. But it wasn't necessary. No one had come and everything was exactly as we had left it. And the owner himself was there, though not in form. Since bodies decompose very quickly in water, his face was...

You get the idea.
"But look at what he's turned into!" Anton said.
"I suggest we search the apartment and get the hell out, as quickly as possible." I replied.

We thought we'd start by examining Bonchev's work, i.e., the blueprints scattered throughout his apartment, but there were so many that we could hardly go through all of them, and they were so complex that we wouldn't fully understand even one of them.
"Are they only written with formulas?" I asked.
"There's a little text here too." The Curious One waved a small piece of paper. "Some reflections on life."
"Do they match your theory of what he was like?"

Instead of answering me, Anton started reading:

And the image of the superman, described by Nietzsche, is one of the greatest myths of the 20th century. The heroes of Ayn Rand, who never doubt themselves and their goals, are also a myth. Because fanatics and careerists will never have abilities that can match their self-confidence. The true striving for self-improvement does not come from an ambition to be better, but from the realization of how pitiful we actually are. And true understanding is nothing other than reverence for that which we cannot...

"Okay, that's enough for now... Does this match your idea of Bonchev?"
"I don't know, but it sounds quite interesting..." Anton said in a tone that hinted he had gotten sidetracked again and had forgotten where he was and why.
"Yes, it's interesting, but it doesn't help us!" I said. "Come on, keep searching!"





----------------

i wouldn't say this out loud, but i think i became a programmer precisely because of that desire for control that anton talked about. it's a job that isolates you from all unpredictable factors and where everything that happens is a direct or indirect result of your actions – in the good case direct, and in the bad – indirect. complete control. and from there comes my problem. to believe that i am some form of messiah would mean to admit to myself that i have no power over myself, and that my fate depends entirely on an unexplored force whose purpose is unknown to me.

"I know who you are. If I only knew who *I* am"


-----------

I was still gathering my thoughts when I picked up the phone and dialed my office number:
"Hello, Yule, is that you?"
"What's up?" answered the HR girl at my company – a girl my age who dressed provocatively and wore braces, which gave her some strange sex appeal.
"Sasho, is that you?" She spoke with an echo, as she often did. Probably because all day she had to watch sloppily looking men talk about things incomprehensible to her.
"Can I not come to work tomorrow..." I got straight to the point. "I have some personal matters."
"I have to ask Velislav. (That was the first name of Strugački.) Actually, do you want to ask him yourself, he wanted to talk to you about something anyway..."
"Excuse me? What did he want to talk about?"
"Oh, I have no idea. I'll connect you so you can sort it out..."

She hung up the phone, and for a minute, the hold melody, which was some variation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, started playing through the receiver.

Then my boss picked up:
"Hello?"
"Hello, hi," I said and paused, expecting him to yell at me about the crashed machine from last time (which didn't happen). "I want to ask you for something..."
"Just say what." He said.
"Is that irony?"
"No, no... I'm completely serious. Yesterday you made a big breakthrough. Even though you didn't solve the problem, you proved that you are much closer to the solution than everyone else. Including..." – he uttered the next sentence in a tone as if he were telling me I'd won a Nobel Prize – "Including me."
"And what follows from that?"
"We can assign a few guys to help you. A slightly better computer? A higher salary?"
"No, I actually just want a one-week leave."
He made a short pause.
"I'm sorry, but that's impossible!"

NOTE:
Not to be sure about anything.

"I won't let you go," he continued. "After you finish what you started, then you can go on leave. Not before."
"But I don't even know if I'm capable..."
"You are capable."

I hung up the phone.

Here was another person who thought I was Chosen.

I returned to the room, and with Anton, we started discussing how to proceed from here:
"Now..." I said while trying to gather my thoughts. "They refused my leave. We have to plan things so that I can go to work tomorrow."
"Looks like things are getting tangled again, huh?" Anton smiled, as if it gave him pleasure to watch new and new problems appearing before me.
"What's so funny about that?" I asked irritably.
"Nothing," he said, but didn't stop smiling.
"Frankly, you know what. I mean..." I stood up to look for my jacket with my eyes. "I want to solve this myself."
"Is there a problem?"
"I just want to go out and get some air..."
"But why? Engineer-boy... What's the problem?"
"Stay sober for a day and you'll understand!"

The sun had already finished its shift in our part of the globe and had headed for the next time zone, and the landscape was dotted with large trees that shielded me from the light like a huge canopy. I hailed one of the stray taxis roaming around and sat in the back seat:
"Where to," the driver asked without turning to me.
I explained to him how to get to the place where I had seen the Phenomenon. And the whole way, I tried to answer the question of why I wanted to go there.

"Wait for me here," I said when we arrived. "I'll pay you now. If I don't come back in about ten minutes, which is most likely what will happen, just leave. Okay?"
He nodded.
"Oh, and one more thing," I added after getting out of the car. "If you could turn off your headlights for a bit."

The xenon light went out, and the night enveloped the whole space, which was essentially its own. Staggering, I headed towards the mountain, guided only by moonlight. I closed my eyes and continued walking forward, stumbling over stones. I had a feeling I could sense the Phenomenon. I reached a little higher, knelt on the muddy clearing, and raised my hands up.

Nothing happened.

After about five minutes, I stood up, partly desperate and partly mocking myself, and started wiping the mud off my shoes so as not to dirty the car.
"Where to now?" the taxi driver asked curiously.
"I don't know yet," I said. "Drive somewhere towards the city."

As we approached the suburbs, the natural scenery gradually began to turn into urban. Less grass, more asphalt. Fewer trees and more traffic lights and billboards, each of which seemed to insist on your attention and hypnotized you as if in some failed experiment. Waffles, Mobile phones, cars, soft drinks, real estate agencies... I would have looked at them the whole journey if the taxi driver hadn't brought me back to earth:
"Look, please call the guys with the white Rover to hurry up a bit."
"Who?"
"Well, those guys there." He adjusted the rearview mirror and pointed at the car.
"What about them?"
"I thought they were your friends..."
"Why?"
"Well, they've been following us the whole way."

NOTE:
I should always have a Plan B. Preferably, I also need plans C, D, E, F, G, H, and a few extra letters of the alphabet.

For a while, I looked back and forth, and finally decided to share my concerns with the driver:
"I don't know these people," I said. "And I don't want to get to know them, if you know what I mean."
"Excuse me?"
"Step on it!"
He gasped with concern but pressed the gas pedal a little harder. The Rover caught up with us without a problem, and I realized I was acting on instinct. That wouldn't do. I needed a plan and I needed to start building it immediately. With one glance at the Rover, I noted the car model and the driver's appearance. Then I paid attention to the car I was in.

NOTE:
Before you act, gather all relevant information.

"Okay. New strategy. Slow down to the slowest possible speed that would arouse suspicion."
"Slow down?"
"Listen to me. Our car has maybe seventy-five horsepower, and that one behind has at least a hundred and twenty."
"Yes, and..."
"And obviously, we won't be able to shake them off on the road. Better to be slower so I have time to think about how to do it afterwards."

I leaned back on the seat with the idea of contemplating the issue. Suddenly, I felt the pain in my head again (it had never appeared in such a situation before). It intensified quickly and almost immediately became unbearable.

I remember very well what happened next – I instinctively started moving my head in all directions. At one point, my gaze fixed upward at the sky. And for a moment, the sky erupted like a volcano. A strong light enveloped my entire horizon. It didn't come from the sun or a beam. It came from everywhere. For a moment, I couldn't make out the car, I couldn't make out anything around me because the light was so strong it blinded everything else. Instinctively, I reached for the door handle, but it had disappeared. Everything had disappeared, as if I were floating in zero gravity. For a few seconds, my eyes adjusted to the light, and I noticed the shadows of two people sitting about five meters from me. One of them nudged the other and pointed at me. I waved back.

This lasted for a fraction of a second, after which things returned to their initial situation – I was again sitting in the back seat of the car, with messy hair and dressed in a crumpled white shirt, and the white Rover was chasing me again.

But I wasn't worried about that anymore. I didn't care anymore whether I would escape or not. I didn't care who my pursuers were or what they wanted from me. Even though I knew I would probably escape, and find out.

"Hey, what was that?" the driver called out.
"I don't know."
"Whatever... Where should I take you now?"

I looked around and saw we had reached the city.
"Straight ahead," I said. "I'll tell you when to turn."
He nodded and fell silent, but after a few minutes, he spoke up again:
"Why are they chasing you?"
"I have no idea."
"You're bullshitting me, but alright." He waved his hand.
"How are you so sure?"
He looked at me with a smile he seemed to have practiced in front of the mirror even before he started driving a taxi:
"Well, if you have no idea why they're chasing you, then why are you running?"

I told the taxi driver to head towards the center – near the neighborhood where I grew up. Along the way, the Rover kept appearing. I saw it only from time to time, but often enough to be convinced that someone was really following me. But I already had a plan. I intended to make them sweat for their money. Literally.

"Now, after two blocks, you'll turn left and stop in front of a place called 'Tantra' massage and sauna salon. I'll get out immediately, but you'll stay for another fifteen minutes. And if someone gets out and follows me, I want you to honk the horn. Honk twice if there are two of them. Then you drive off. Will you do it?"
"No."

He refused on the grounds that he was worried, and I had to give him almost all the money I had on me (about ten levs), leaving myself only enough to pay the sauna entrance fee. The girl at the cash register looked at me strangely – 99 percent of the visitors were regular clients, and new people stood out. That was one of the reasons I chose this place (the other two were that its entrance faced a busy street and that I knew the neighborhood). I paid her for two hours and checked my watch to know when they would run out, even though I planned to leave much earlier. Then I headed towards the left door, which led to the men's locker room. Fortunately, it was empty, and I didn't have to undress in front of other people.

The room was tiled. It contained two showers, about fifty metal lockers for clothes, and right next to the door leading to the sauna, there were about ten white terry cloth towels. I took one of them and unbuttoned my shirt. The taxi horn reminded me I didn't have time to dawdle – I took off my shoes, put on flip-flops, and continued taking off the rest of my clothes.

The towels were a bit short, but this apparently didn't impress the other visitors (about ten people), among whom three or four were professional athletes who had come to relax after training at the gym, five or six amateur athletes who kept their bodies in shape, and the rest – older men for whom the sauna was the urban equivalent of fishing – an excuse to sit for half an hour doing absolutely nothing. Between the second and third type was a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, who looked roughly my age. When I got a little closer, I realized he was exactly my age – we had studied in the same school up to seventh grade. His name was Alexander, like me. But that's where the similarities ended. He was Sasho, the captain of the football team, Sasho, whom all the girls liked. He had a pleasant character. It seemed super to me to meet him – his presence fit well into my plan.

NOTE:
If someone is chasing you, run to a place where they won't feel comfortable.

A little later, the door opened, and three men came out, two of whom immediately started greeting their friends, and the third (forty years old, shaved head, and a criminal face) remained by the door, visibly anxious. However he had planned to hide, it didn't work out. He glanced at me for a second and immediately averted his gaze, watching me with his peripheral vision. I decided to demonstrate to him that I wasn't alone and turned to my classmate:
"How are things with you?" I asked him.
He, like no one else, actually started answering me:
"Can't complain," he said. "Work is OK – a travel agency, two blocks from here, the money's coming in, and the job too. I graduated in Tourism from NBU, so it's in my field."
"Sounds good."
"And one more thing. Do you remember Zori from the next class?"
"Yeah?"
"We got married a year ago..."
"Congratulations."
"...and we're expecting our first child now."
"I envy you," I said. And I really did envy him. He certainly wasn't a potential prime suspect in a murder and wasn't being chased by nasty guys with shaved heads.

"Have you seen anyone from the class?" Sasho asked.
"Well, no... Except Anton. I've been hanging out with him regularly lately..."
"You hang out with Anton the Curious One?" He didn't know how to react, so he tried to smile. "Is he still..."
"Yes." I remembered the line I had left them with. "And in ever-increasing quantities."
"I don't know why you're friends with him," Sasho said. "He's a complete freak. In every class, there are two or three agents who I have no idea what they're doing on this planet."
"Who else was like that, in your opinion?"
"Snowball is like that and currently..." Without meaning to, Sasho named the second person from the class who seemed interesting to me.
"Currently? Have you seen him recently?"
"I run into him in the neighborhood from time to time. He already has a PhD in higher mathematics, and something else I don't remember. He writes, I think, for some scientific journals, but I don't know if they even pay him. Judging by his clothes, probably not..."
"Don't judge by clothes."
"Just in case, he still lives with his mother. Has no friends and still wears that ridiculous yellow jacket... Freak."

His way of reasoning began to interest me:
"So, the Curious One and Snowball are freaks. Is there anyone else? Me, for example?"
"There's nothing wrong with you. I just don't know why you complicate your life."
"How so?"
"For example, what are you going to do tonight?"
"Well..."
"Exactly!" he said. "Shall I tell you what I'm going to do?" He said. "On the way back, I'll buy a few chilled pork chops and two kilos of potatoes and head straight home, because my wife has invited some friends over. We'll have some fun. After they leave, my wife and I will have sex and go to bed."
"And?"
"That's it!" Sasho's tone conveyed genuine astonishment at the existence of people who didn't understand his theory of life. "I mean, it's scientifically proven that there's no one above us or below us. And for me, there's nothing else besides the pork chops, my wife, work, pleasant conversations... If you're not happy with that, it's better... I don't know what's better, but that's my opinion."
"You can't claim something is scientifically proven," I said. There are many theories that are widely accepted, but they still remain just theories, possible explanations of a given phenomenon.
"And what about it?"
"Well, your peaceful life is built on abstractions. On things you consider certain, but which are not certain at all."
"Look, my time's up, I have to go," he said. "Take care of your own life. The rest are details." I watched him leave the room, whistling to himself.

To take care of my life – that's exactly what I intended to do. I got up, went to the back of the room, and entered one of the private massage rooms, where the man couldn't possibly follow me. There, I was greeted by a girl with an artificially acquired tan and a black tattoo on one shoulder:
"Full body, sweetie?" She smiled at me.
"No."
"Then?"
"I just came to get changed," I said and took off the towel I was wrapped in.

NOTE:
Choose one of the things the opponent won't expect from you and use it when the time comes.

Before that, while in the locker room, I hadn't taken off my pants, I had just rolled up the legs so it wasn't noticeable I was still wearing them. Besides, I had tucked my shirt into my waistband. My shoes – tied with their laces, were hanging on the inside of my hips. All my clothes were hidden under the towel. In the locker in the changing room, there was only a torn page from my notebook reading:

NOTE:
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME.

"Is there an exit from here?" The girl just pointed to a small window that looked out onto the inner courtyard. Too small. I was forced to go back to the sauna.

My pursuer needed about two seconds to orient himself in the newly created situation. That's all I needed to reach the exit. In one breath, I ran a twenty-meter sprint. Then I stopped and fixed my gaze on the exit. After a few seconds, my pursuer pushed the door open. He got rid of his flip-flops and then looked around with jerky movements, holding onto his towel. Three schoolgirls in pleated skirts were sitting at the bus stop, and one of them burst out laughing at the sight of him.
"What are you laughing at?" He turned to her, which made her laugh even louder. Then he saw me.

He was fast, but the fact that he was barefoot gave me a big advantage, and I knew the streets where I had played hide-and-seek and tag as a child. Without looking back, I turned into the alleys and started zigzagging through my neighborhood. I entered an inner courtyard and squeezed through a hole in the wall that I remembered from childhood. Then I broke off a few branches and tried to camouflage the hole. The running man, wrapped in a towel, was about three hundred meters away. That was the last time I saw him. Correction – the second-to-last time.

I had already lost my pursuer and gradually slowed my pace. In the end, I wasn't even walking, I was just shuffling, with that gait that wears out the soles of my shoes in negative time. Then I reached it. My home.

I hadn't been there in a long time, but it was as if time had stopped to wait for me to return. On the left was the bakery where we used to shop. Opposite – that store that changed its purpose every two months. On the right – the big street they didn't let me cross alone until seventh grade. And in front of me was the double door with a black mesh that led to the apartment where my mother and father lived.

I don't know why I came here. Maybe my meeting with Sasho had subconsciously influenced me and I wanted to feel secure. "A dinner at mom and dad's and then I'll continue." That all sounded reasonable, but I had never been reasonable. I had always been smart, but never reasonable.

I opened the door and pressed the buzzer with my surname written on it.

I don't know if I was Chosen, but I'm sure I was what Sasho had just called a freak. I didn't feel attachment to anything, and the conventional logic with which most people identify intellect was as boring to me as a seventh hour of math. I wouldn't make a good programmer – I didn't possess a single one of the qualities required to be one (dedication, organizational skills) and the worst part was that I didn't want to acquire them. I didn't want to change.

I thought again about Strugački, who obviously was very keen to get what he wanted and thought I could give it to him. I wished I could explain to him what had happened and why he was wrong to hope. I wished I could tell him something like: "Look, don't imagine my ability (if it can even be called that) is like yours. You know the problems you might encounter along the way. I don't. You are in full control of the situation – I can't even control myself. I don't know where I'm going, nor if I'll get there or not. The fact that I wrote the code myself was an impulse that appears and disappears, like the headache that causes it. An impulse that..."

I interrupted my mental dialogue because right then I had one of those impulses. I turned, waved at the image of my mother that had appeared on the intercom, and headed in the opposite direction.



----------


We will have to stop and wait. A group of children will pass by us – about twenty kids aged between eight and ten. They will be holding hands in pairs and walking in a line, as if they were links of some huge caterpillar. And in the place of the caterpillar's head – an adult woman (apparently a teacher) will try to maintain order in this whole mess, applying the old polished techniques: "Everyone look after your buddy! Don't get lost! Ivcho, why are you gaping!"
"Brother, do you see her?" – The Little Engineer will say. That's Bаeva. Our Bulgarian teacher."
"Which one was she?"
"Don't you remember? The one who constantly said I had a problem with concentration."
"I don't remember her."
"And those two boys there? Could they be us two?"
The woman will shout loudly enough to be heard even by the farthest pairs of children. We will also hear what she says:
"These, children, are typical American beatniks from the sixties." She will point to the hippie camp we found at the beginning of our journey. "They live in communes, separate from civilization, and travel continuously in search of the meaning of life."
The children will look dully at the people dressed in colorful clothes.
"And these are our ancestors." The woman will point to the fortress we also passed. "They worshiped the god Tangra. Tangra in our language means Sun. They believed he was the source of their strength."
I finally remembered this teacher.
"And this," she will point to the hunters. "A group of men who have gone out to kill animals. Killing, of course, is a very bad thing, but their hobby makes them feel they have power over nature and helps them be strong during the rest of the time."
The children will start whispering to each other. Then the teacher will point to a man, about 30 years old, who will be sitting on the grass with headphones stuck in his ears, watching some movie on his portable device.
"And do you see this person? Movies and the Internet help him cope with stress. There he sees something familiar, made-up. But we must not forget that movies are more important than real life."
Along the way, the teacher will continue to briefly explain each of the inhabitants of this meadow. A little before leaving, she will make her conclusion:
"And remember, children. Each of these people has their own way of surviving. And when you grow up, you can also choose any of these ways. You will be able to rely on your entertainments –" The woman will point to the family. "On your faith." – She will point to the bivouac with the fires. "Or on whatever else you want. Just remember one thing: Never be like, that guy over there."
And she will point to me.
"This one really spoke her mind." – The Little Engineer will look around, as if someone patted him on the shoulder and then ran away.
"Take it easy. The kids who have a chance of becoming like me wouldn't have listened to the teacher anyway."
"Unfortunately, you're right."
"Come on now. Lead me to whatever we're headed for, whatever it is."

Mentally, I went over our last conversation and answered myself for what Anton was experiencing. He really liked the fact that the Phenomenon existed. It made his life more beautiful because the reality beyond the limits of our understanding made him forget about that other reality we face every day (drugs had the same effect on him). A little while ago, Mirko, and to some extent I, had hinted to him that the Phenomenon didn't exist. And that was apparently enough to shake his own faith.

He sat on the sidewalk and seemed to wait for something to happen. I wanted to ask him immediately how he felt, but instead I sat next to him and waited for him to speak first:

"It's gone, seems like," he said.

"Maybe."

"Engineer. Didn't you support that evolution theory?"

"I find it meaningful, yes," I said cautiously, expecting him to explode. Instead, he got annoyed:

"I know you find it meaningful, but I'm asking something else: Do you think it applies now. To us humans. That the world we inhabit at the moment is one big progress machine, driven by the 'fittest'?"

"And what if it is?"

"Well, nothing, I was just wondering what my role is in such a world?!"

"Well, it's simple. So, when the circumstances around you change, you adapt to them, because otherwise you'll die. In a way, the reason for change is your self-preservation instinct, or in other words, fear of death. Because that's what the self-preservation instinct is—fear of death, right?"

"And?"

"Well, okay, now imagine some guy like me, who isn't afraid of death, and lives as he WANTS, not as is best for him? A person who just wants to live as he likes. If we're just a more talkative version of animals, where is THAT PERSON'S place in the picture?"

It struck me how The Curious One seemed to be hiding himself under the expression "that person."

"Well, aren't you afraid of death?"

"I have no idea. Stop asking questions."

"Sorry. That's probably the only thing I know how to do."

A girl, roughly our age, passed by us, riding a bicycle. I got déjà vu. I had the feeling I'd seen her somewhere, but couldn't remember exactly where. She, however, apparently remembered, because she turned the handlebars and headed toward me.

NOTE:

To remember the names of people I interact with (or at least those of them who remember mine).

I stood up and looked at her more closely, rummaging through the memories in my brain in search of the one connected to her. "Who is she? What if she stops and talks to me. What will I say to her?" I was wondering things like that when The Curious One snapped me out of my trance, only to excite me even more with a name he uttered simultaneously as an exclamation and a question:

"LILIYAAAAAA!?"

The girl approached me and looked me over from head to toe. The resemblance was striking. I hadn't seen my girl in years, but somehow with my heart I knew it was her. I blushed all over. From nervousness, I couldn't open my mouth, even though I wanted to tell her many things. Or rather one thing, but many times. A little after she passed me, she stopped, turned to me, and uttered two short words:

"Me too."

As I watched her silhouette disappear into the darkness, something got in my eye.

Suddenly, the answers to all my questions shone like fireworks, and I understood everything I wanted to know. The Curious One ran up to me, still unable to catch his breath from surprise and fatigue. Seeing my calm expression, he immediately understood he had catching up to do and began interrogating me.



-----




NOTE:
I don't need him at all.
"Hey, what are you writing there?" He craned his neck to peek into my notebook.
"What's it to you?" I closed it so he couldn't see. "You know I sometimes write some other thoughts in here."
"Sometimes?"
I realized that in the last hour, I had filled two pages with notes.
"I'm just writing some..." I continued to make excuses. "Some of MY own things."
"Aha." He assumed a disinterested look, but then quickly reached for the notebook and with a jerky movement snatched it from my hands.
"Give it back to me right now!" I heard my own voice.
"'Follow your own advice,'" Anton was reading. "What does that mean? 'Don't ask stupid questions, unless you want to hear stupid answers.' Arguments with Lovedearly are meaningless by definition, huh? 'When I'm sleepy, I should go to sleep?!' 'Pay more attention to details.' What are these stupidities?"
"Yes, they are complete stupidities. Now, will you give it back to me?"
"And you think they can help you with something..." He continued reading in a mocking voice: "'To not be sure of anything... To have a plan B...' Damn it..."
"Give it to me right now!"
"'To put an end to all of this.'"
"I said give it to me!"
"Wait, it's getting more interesting." After a while, he came across the last note I had written and read it with a questioning intonation:
"'I don't need him at all'? For the first time, I saw traces of anger creeping onto his face.
"No, Anton. Listen. That's not true!"
"Then why did you write it?!" He asked.
"Because..."
And suddenly I understood the answer. It's just that lately, I had imperceptibly started using the notebook as a catalyst for my insecurity. As if I had developed some kind of schizophrenia... As if these notes weren't written by me, but were rather the product of some desperate personality writhing in pre-death throes and living solely from the energy obtained when the pen touched the white sheet.
"I understand why you're doing it." Lovedearly was talking to me. "Been there, so to speak... You know, you forget various things, and that terrifies you. So you decide to STORE all the information you get your hands on. You write down everything that comes to your mind."
"Well, I might need them..." I said.
"Yeah, you're just terrified that some thought might remain only in you, without you using it. But hear this. Sometimes..."

'I must come to my senses'
"...the effect is the opposite... I mean, that little by little it starts to become a fixation for you that you'll miss something important. You start writing things that have no importance at all. Then you look them over and search for the answer in them. But it was in you. The whole time. So obvious that it seemed trivial to you.

NOTE:
I don't understand anything.
"Stop writing for a second and listen to me!" Anton said.
"But what answer are you talking about?" I asked him. "Alright. Let me think for a bit: All this is happening because..." I stopped mid-sentence and took a gulp of air. "No, actually, I have no idea why it's happening..."
"Because you started it." Apparently, I had asked in the right way, because Anton smiled.
"When I saw the Phenomenon, did I start everything?"
"No, before that. From the very first moment, when you started thinking about the Core Algorithm..."
"Wait, maybe you should first explain to me how you got the core algorithm running?"
"Me?" Lovedearly couldn't finish his sentence because he choked on laughter. "What gave you that idea?"
"Who then?"
"I'll give you a hint: the simplest answer is the correct one. Still don't get it? Is it so hard to remember that YOU DID IT. I just loaded your file."
"I didn't manage to finish the file." I objected.
"Not that file. I'm talking about the file you started everything with. The file you wrote even before seeing the Phenomenon. On the damn fifteenth of February!"
"That file?" I immediately returned to the first page. My face – filled with even greater surprise. "But it was empty." I said. "There was only one symbol there. One question mark..."
He smiled.
"Is that so little?"
He raised an eyebrow and spread his hands to emphasize the effect of his remark, but due to the lack of such, he remained in that position for a few seconds, then got tired of sitting up straight and positioned himself on the sofa.
"What, do you mean?" Questions were already filling my mouth, like saliva fills the mouth when hungry. "That in place of the CA, there's a file containing a question mark? But that's not possible... Or is it because of the high level of abstraction? But wait. How did Strugatski react to this?"
"Probably too excited to check right away..."
"Yeah, I can imagine how he felt..." I said. "Considering how I feel..."
"Why, Little Engineer? I mean... is it so hard for you to accept it?"
"To accept what?"
Alright, you have written a computer program that aims to resemble our brain. So the question in the case is: What do the two have in common?
"Yeah, that's what I was asking myself too."
"And what is it? Both the brain and the software have functions that are embedded in them."
"Embedded?"
"Well, yeah. For example, in our brain, the function of keeping us alive is embedded, that is, the self-preservation instinct. Right? The reproductive function is also embedded – for preserving the species. And every program has functions, so I don't need to lecture you on that."
Then: both need information to perform their functions, right? And as a result, both, so to speak, ask questions. Yes. But our brain, unlike the software, also asks questions that are not related to the functions it performs. You see? That's why we can't structure our knowledge. We can try, but we'll never succeed. Because we ask just like that... Just because we want to know. That's our nature.
And for that reason, I was telling you that this thing... – He pointed to the notebook. "...can sometimes seriously mess with your brain."
"Yeah." I nodded. "I understand now."
"You understood it before." He said.
"You mean when the ray appeared?"
"I mean it didn't appear, damn it! I mean, it has always been there. It's just that a person appeared who wanted to know where it came from."
"Yeah." I took a breath. Are you sure it has always been there?
He smiled.
"I bet it's there now too."
Anton shook me to snap me out of my trance:
"Stop lounging around." He said. "Help me with the luggage."
"Take it easy, we won't be late."
He didn't catch the irony in my note. Instead, he started giving me instructions in minimal words: "Take the batteries out of the remote and put them in the flashlight." "The tent from the top cabinet." "A few knives from the kitchen – we'll use them instead of pegs."
While I was preparing my luggage, I watched how Lovedearly prepared his. First, he prepared a few T-shirts and pants, and stuffed them into his bag without folding them. Some food from the fridge, various other life-saving provisions like a laptop, MP3 player, and flashlight.
Then I realized that the similarities between him and the Snowball were becoming more and more obvious. How hadn't I seen them until now? Like Anton, just like Mirko, he was trying to be better than the rest. And Anton had something in his life that stood above everything else. And moreover, he planned his actions with the same attention and determination... The only difference was that the Snowball was moving towards a specific goal, which he saw crystal clear, while Anton and I, just as confidently, were moving towards the UNKNOWN.

NOTE:
The notebook was in my right pocket. There, where it had sat throughout my conscious life, ready to record everything I learned over the years. I took it out and with a precise parabola, I managed to throw it into the trash can on the first try.
After a few days, I dug it out from there to compose this text based on it.

Something had happened to Anton after we left. His smile had vanished, and his face now looked broken and unhappy. I was used to such changes: he often jumped from states of purest joy to mind-boggling despair, the change always instantaneous and easily noticeable, as if someone were switching his moods with a remote. And when we left the apartment, that remote was switched to the "DEPRESSION" channel.

"What's wrong with you?" I asked him.

Mentally, I went over our last conversation and answered myself for what Anton was experiencing. He really liked the fact that the Phenomenon existed. It made his life more beautiful because the reality beyond the limits of our understanding made him forget about that other reality we face every day (drugs had the same effect on him). A little while ago, Mirko, and to some extent I, had hinted to him that the Phenomenon didn't exist. And that was apparently enough to shake his own faith.

He sat on the sidewalk and seemed to wait for something to happen. I wanted to ask him immediately how he felt, but instead I sat next to him and waited for him to speak first:

"It's gone, seems like," he said.

"Maybe."

"Engineer. Didn't you support that evolution theory?"

"I find it meaningful, yes," I said cautiously, expecting him to explode. Instead, he got annoyed:

"I know you find it meaningful, but I'm asking something else: Do you think it applies now. To us humans. That the world we inhabit at the moment is one big progress machine, driven by the 'fittest'?"

"And what if it is?"

"Well, nothing, I was just wondering what my role is in such a world?!"

"Well, it's simple. So, when the circumstances around you change, you adapt to them, because otherwise you'll die. In a way, the reason for change is your self-preservation instinct, or in other words, fear of death. Because that's what the self-preservation instinct is—fear of death, right?"

"And?"

"Well, okay, now imagine some guy like me, who isn't afraid of death, and lives as he WANTS, not as is best for him? A person who just wants to live as he likes. If we're just a more talkative version of animals, where is THAT PERSON'S place in the picture?"

It struck me how The Curious One seemed to be hiding himself under the expression "that person."

"Well, aren't you afraid of death?"

"I have no idea. Stop asking questions."

"Sorry. That's probably the only thing I know how to do."

A girl, roughly our age, passed by us, riding a bicycle. I got déjà vu. I had the feeling I'd seen her somewhere, but couldn't remember exactly where. She, however, apparently remembered, because she turned the handlebars and headed toward me.

NOTE:

To remember the names of people I interact with (or at least those of them who remember mine).

I stood up and looked at her more closely, rummaging through the memories in my brain in search of the one connected to her. "Who is she? What if she stops and talks to me. What will I say to her?" I was wondering things like that when The Curious One snapped me out of my trance, only to excite me even more with a name he uttered simultaneously as an exclamation and a question:

"LILIYAAAAAA!?"

The girl approached me and looked me over from head to toe. The resemblance was striking. I hadn't seen my girl in years, but somehow with my heart I knew it was her. I blushed all over. From nervousness, I couldn't open my mouth, even though I wanted to tell her many things. Or rather one thing, but many times. A little after she passed me, she stopped, turned to me, and uttered two short words:

"Me too."

As I watched her silhouette disappear into the darkness, something got in my eye.

Suddenly, the answers to all my questions shone like fireworks, and I understood everything I wanted to know. The Curious One ran up to me, still unable to catch his breath from surprise and fatigue. Seeing my calm expression, he immediately understood he had catching up to do and began interrogating me.
