I'm with Mirko, and with us is Liliya (and probably The Curious One is playing "Pirates and Bones" with the other boys, or running so as not to miss another episode of Star Trek). She smiles at us and talks to us about all sorts of things. She says that most people in our class behave very immaturely toward Mirko. She wonders why they insult him so much.

I tell her that there probably isn't any reason for them to insult him, and it's more likely they're just doing it (at that time, I was also on the receiving end of a fair amount of teasing). She objects, saying there must be a reason for them to do it. Finally, she prompts Mirko himself, as the smartest, to give his opinion.

He tells us that he doesn't care what others think, and advises us not to listen to them either, because if we do, we won't get anywhere in life.

I suggest to Mirko and Liliya that we not go home right after school, but instead sit a while in the little garden (this garden no longer exists). Liliya agrees immediately, but Snowball says he doesn't have time for that because he has to study. I pretend to be offended, but secretly I'm glad he won't be with us, because that way I'll have a chance to sit alone with Liliya. I finally decide to confess to her that I'm in love with her, as I'd been planning to do for a long time.

The weather is nice. She lies down on the tennis table and I lie down next to her, using our school backpacks as pillows. Then we get caught up in some interesting conversation about the world, in which each of us says what we've heard, from school or from home, and together we try to explain what they don't tell us.

After a certain time, our conversation is interrupted—Liliya's sister comes to call her for dinner. She tells her that their mother is very angry that she didn't come home while it was still light again. Liliya gets scared and immediately leaves. And when I'm parting with her, I realize I forgot to tell her I love her.

"Nothing," I say to myself. "Next time."
