And the boys and girls in my class really didn't like him at all. And before, we often wondered why that was. And now, when I thought about it, I managed to come up with a theory that answered this question.

The case is this: To function normally, a person needs to have a high opinion of themselves, and it affects them badly when another person who is proven to be better at something (or, as in this case, at many things) crushes their self-esteem. In this case, each person individually would try to justify to themselves the arrogance of that more perfect individual. And all the people together had managed to do this by collectively hating him and transferring onto him the negative feelings they felt toward themselves.

Certainly, this picture isn't entirely accurate and is quite simplified, but thanks to it, I somewhat understood why Snowball was the object of so much mockery. What I still had no idea about was why he paid them no attention. Mockery at school usually inflicts very heavy damage on the psyche (after all, I'd had close encounters with psychologists and knew this), and its victims often spend their entire lives trying to be as "normal" and indistinguishable as possible, hoping they'll be left alone (which never happens). Here I was dealing with a person who hadn't changed one bit all these years, and who never started caring more about others' opinions—quite the opposite.

"And why did you behave like that with me when we were in school? Ten years have passed, boys. I thought you understood that lasting self-esteem is achieved by accomplishing something yourself, not by mocking people who have accomplished something."

Then I understood how Mirko managed to overcome all the humiliations in our class and escape the blows everyone tried to inflict on him—he simply knew they were doing it out of envy. He knew he was better than them and knew that their mockery was actually desperate attempts to suppress their own insecurity. And his knowledge allowed him to be himself.
