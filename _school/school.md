I remember the first day at school. 

We were all standing in the schoolyard, roaming, some aimlessly, some trying to form groups, lead them. 

Some of us were not afraid to show our shock, or perhaps were too afraid to hide it, and some were posing, pretending they knew what school was about. About studying, about socialization, about making connections.

But they all had a *different* idea, which, for me, clearly meant none of them was correct. I knew that noone knew, noone ever knew what school was about. None of the teachers and none of the students. They all came there every morning, sometimes before the sun was ever sat to pretend that what they did mattered. They came to prove to themselves and others that their lie was more truthful than the other's lie. They came to play they role, tried to play it in a way that was so convincing that all others would join in.

And I suppose in some times and places some of them would succeed. I've heard that there are schools where the curriculum was king, when everyone was wearing uniforms and rarely did anything besides studying. Schools where the students aimed to one day be like their teachers, and, on the contrary, I know that there are schools where kids come just to "play", schools where it was the *teachers* who were driven to despair, and where everyone knew that the curriculum was pro-forma, that school was just so kids can be *somewhere* while the parents were at work. 

But my school was neither of those. My school was a place where the abstraction leaked.
