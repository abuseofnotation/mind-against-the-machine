In the following days, Anna discarded all my attempts to establish any kind of connection with her. At that time I thought that she had decided that she didn't like me and that this was her way of showing me that she didn't want to be in a relatioship with me, or, what I hoped for, that she liked me so much that she got afraid of the emotional commitment that our first date entailed, but later I learned that the reality of it was (as I would probably could have realized right away, if I wasn't so damn self-centered) that she just didn't know how to continue the game. That, although I knew her for just a few days, I had already reached the end stage of the relationship with her. I didn't know that I had already walked through every path of the neat small park that was her persona. And therefore there was no way for her to lead me to a route that wouldn't feel for me as if we are rolling in circles, no route that would distract me enough to so I don't see what the rest of her

The ladder that you don't need when you reach the peak... being bottisattva means dedicating your life not on climbing, but on keeping that ladder in tact, so other people can climb it.

And, also, when needed, patching the ladder, putting large neon signs around it "To enlightement" on it, and sometimes fruitlessly trying to pull people up).

The thoughts are images. You cannot think about a person or a thing, your brain doesn't contain that person or a thing within itself. You are just thinking about *your* representation of the thing, which also isn't connected to it. Your thoughts can influence reality to a certain extend, but that doesn't alter the fact that you are just fooling yourself that you are thinking about something, while in reality.

It was then I realized that thoughts don't lead to desires, thoughts *are* desires everything you think about is actually (as we established) an image of the actual thing, followed by the desire for the actual thing to be the same as the image (which it cannot be).
