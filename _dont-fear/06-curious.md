As usual, the front door was unlocked. I passed through it while unbuttoning the top button of my shirt, and shouted some standard greeting:

"Hello, people..."
{: .voice-x}

No one answered. The large room, where Curious and their countless tenants usually sat, was completely empty. I continued calling them and my voice echoed in the high ceiling of the house. Finally I heard Anton responding.

"I'm heeere! Stop shouting!"
{: .voice-curious}

I ran to the corner of the room and saw them lying on the floor and rolling around in crumpled books, McDonald's hamburger bags, and empty caffeine pill packages. Their hair—disheveled, their eyes—so red that they looked like blood would flow from them. And on their mouth, in contrast to their pitiful appearance, was a smile.

There are things you just don't get used to...
{: .note}

For some reason I tried to compare them to my manager, Anhela. Her flawless appearance versus the pitiful way Curious looked right now. Her calm, deliberate tone versus their frantic blabbering. The way she always stayed with her back straight, versus them, sprawled on the floor and... I couldn't compare them—I felt as if even the impressions of those two people that I had in my mind were so incompatible that their simultaneous existence caused me fatigue.

"Where is everyone?"
{: .voice-x}

"Who's everyone?"
{: .voice-curious}

They shifted from lying to sitting.

"Your tenants. The ones who are fucking here all the time."
{: .voice-x}

"Aah, I kicked them out of this room. They're probably somewhere on the upper floors."
{: .voice-curious}

"OK, and why do you look like that?"
{: .voice-x}

They thought for a second.

"Well, it's probably because I haven't slept."
{: .voice-curious}

Then they had me make some variation of coffee according to their recipe: "You make normal coffee, then pour it back into the coffee maker (where the water compartment is), and make it again."

Then, they started telling me about how they had spent the last few days. They spoke with an inflamed tone, as if deliberately wanting to hide how excited they had been during the events they were telling me about.

"I combed through half the Internet while looking for witness accounts of the other beam. When I didn't find anything, I started interrogating all acquaintances and strangers in the city, at least half of whom decided I was completely crazy... Anyway... In the end, an old girlfriend wrote to me. She claims that some neighbor of hers had experienced something similar to what you did. We can check if that's really true."
{: .voice-curious}

"OK, let's do that. But I have something else to tell you about."
{: .voice-x}

Anton made a hand gesture to stop me.

"Wait a sec. I am telling you I found another witness after weeks of work and you FUCKING HAVE SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT! Go on, but it better be related."
{: .voice-curious}

I said that it was related, although actually I wasn't sure and I quickly told the story of what had happened when I first wrote that code.

"So, I sat at my desk, as usual, and suddenly I was there again. There was no light, no nothing, but the feeling was the same. At one point I couldn't control myself anymore. As if it wasn't me then, but something was passing through me and using me. Or I was using it, I have no idea... The best work of my entire career. And it came to nothing... Actually, not exactly nothing..."
{: .voice-x}

And then I tried to tell them the story about me being promoted. I described my semi-sexy manager, the whole awkwardness at the beginning of our conversation. And then, the even more awkward conclusion. This story didn't interest them at all.

"I get it, so, you want to make money? Good, take it. Take the promotion. But what does this have to do with the phenomenon?"
{: .voice-curious}

The way they reacted saddened me. Not because they apparently only wanted to talk about the phenomenon and not about money. It was because for the first time in this weird situation I realized that there was something that I needed more than both money and the phenomenon—I needed to make myself understood. More precisely I needed someone who would understand me. And Anton didn't understand me at all. They didn't understand what a promotion would mean for me. They didn't understand what working with other people meant, didn't understand what it was to be part of something... To need to be VALUED, if you must. The only thing they understood was the fight for survival, a fight that they fought with everyone and all the time. A fight that required cutting all ties, which probably started when ever since they were only a child and the tie with their father was cut for them. That and the transcendent connection with me, which was like a bug in an otherwise perfectly-designed system.

For Anton, money, connections, position in society—all that was trash, trash that some OTHER people valued, but not them. That is probably why they never had any issues with obtaining either of those things. Contrast this with people like Anhela, and you will be on your way to unravel the puzzle of why they are so different—she identified with the very set of things that Anton tried to differentiate themselves from—she existed as part of systems of machines, as I call them. She was an agent of order, Anton—of chaos.

"But a promotion isn't just money."
{: .voice-x}

"Yes, I know you will have to swallow it. We all have to do it, but we don't need to talk about it, right? I mean... swallowing is not interesting."
{: .voice-curious}

I realized I was going crazy just looking at Anton, as if every pore of their skin had turned into a miniature mouth that constantly spat on everything and everyone who had ever set foot on this planet. They were intolerable, but the worst part was that what they said really sounded logical. The nasty brat... Even if they spoke the biggest and most unheard-of nonsense, for some reason when I was with them, it sounded super logical to me.

"No, it's not that either... Look, it's important for me, OK?"
{: .voice-x}

I expected that Anton would be mad, but he just gave me a thumbs up and nodded, in a manner that was very calm. "Anhela won't have such a mature reaction" I thought in passing.

"I was thinking: I have been FIGHTING everyone and everything, this whole time. Perhaps I should try to work with them."
{: .voice-x}

I didn't suspect that this so-called work would involve more fighting than I had ever done.
