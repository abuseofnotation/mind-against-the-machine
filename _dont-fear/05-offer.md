My boss at the time was a very overconfident and neurotic lady to whom I had spoken just a few times before I crashed the servers at work. My tactic was to bother her as little as possible, lest she give me additional work, and it was largely successful—in my time at the office, I had learned to be polite, but not friendly, to help whenever I could, but not actively offer my help. In short, I tried to roam around the office like a ghost; I just came to do my part and disappear before anyone noticed I was there.

Of course, I knew that that was not the best way to behave, but it was the only way for me. Two reasons: one, I really wanted to work on *my* stuff, which always came first, as you know. But two and more importantly—I was never good at doing work, although many people at many times had thought I was... Not then, not now, not ever. This wasn't because I couldn't program well (I really couldn't program well, but, as you will learn, that later turned out to be even an advantage). It was because I could only do things in a way which was so idiosyncratic that I had no desire for anyone else to help me, and in most cases I had even less desire to help anyone else with anything—all that shit was stress. Stress that I didn't bear very well. Perhaps it was because I was afraid of people who had power over me. Or I just cared too much about what I did to really do it right. But investing myself into anything had always been costly, in terms of stress. As a result, my life outside of home had turned into a game of how to best spend my stress points, in a way that would let me advance toward my goals, without tying my stomach into a knot. And often the winning tactic was just not to play.

Anhela wasn't the worst kind of person to be my boss. She actually was the best boss I had ever had, although that didn't mean much, no offense to bosses. She wasn't kind, but at least she was polite. She didn't understand me, but at least she tried to. Plus she was somewhat attractive (a lousy reason for being likeable, but it works every time).

That day I had a meeting with her. And I thought she wanted to reprimand me about crashing the servers, so I went there with my head low, preparing to stay silent while she finished whatever speech she had prepared. And this was exactly the way it seemed that the whole thing would work. I met her. She shook my hand, took her notebook and she led me to the meeting room, without saying a word. But when we took our seats, she started smiling.

"You look good. You usually have your mind wandering, but today we can get somewhere."

She said nothing of the servers and instead started asking me about the code that I wrote last week. Apparently, before it crashed it had passed a significant portion of the tests that it was meant to pass, and so some very high-level people were interested in how it worked. I didn't have much to tell her: in the last few days, I had tried to reconstruct the thing I had done. The attempts were all too painful, and the result wasn't great. I had just 300 lines of code written and they almost didn't do anything. I had no inspiration and I think I had only been able to write them because I used Haskell; I didn't know how I would rewrite them in another language.

I explained to her what had happened. I didn't talk about the phenomenon, I just said I was inspired. I told her what my current progress was.

"That's understandable, those are complex problems."

She smiled again. She asked me what I needed. Then she told me that I was promoted. She valued me. She would assist me however she could. She would assign some people to help me, if I wanted.

"Well, yes, there is one thing that's bothering me..."
{: .voice-x}

The way I talked was weird, to me. The whole thing looked like some kind of prank that someone was playing on me to check how I would respond. But even if it was a hoax, I thought that it would do me no good to behave like an idiot. I had to say something.

"...this technology... this language that I'm using for prototyping, called Haskell... it isn't very popular... But I kinda want to stick with it."
{: .voice-x}

"Is that it? OK, use it."
{: .voice-anhela}

I thought that she didn't get what I was asking. There was no other explanation for why she would agree with something like that, without asking the management, which was very unlikely to agree. The whole thing seemed like a mistake, which would probably cost ME in the long run, when other people found out, so I started explaining to her how important the language was, how unpopular Haskell was, how hard it was to learn etc.

"Wait, I think I may be misunderstanding you. Do you WANT to use Haskell? Then why are you trying to convince me not to use it?"
{: .voice-anhela}

Sometimes it's better to just nod and wink.
{: .note}

After the conversation, she invited me to her office and we had a coffee while she was showing me pictures of her cats (I didn't want to see so many pictures, but I didn't know how to say it to her politely).

The whole meeting left me baffled. Up till that point, the machine had always been hostile toward me. I was always fighting it. It was always my mind against the machine, if you must plug the book title somewhere. And then it suddenly wanted to play with me, and I didn't know how and why the change had occurred.

I knew she was using flattery as a method of persuasion—"you're cool, now would you do that thing for me"—and I had many tactics for refusing such tasks politely, but here the case was different—Haskell was my passion. I really WANTED to program in Haskell (and make some money). All my life I dreamed of someone letting me program in Haskell (and give me some money). At this point the only problems that I had with my life were that I didn't have enough time to write in Haskell... and also the money part, yes. 

So, with my 20-something brain I thought that I'd use the machine to get what I want and then, when I am finished with it, I would move on.
