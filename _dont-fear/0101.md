I stopped in front of the entrance to my apartment, as I had done thousands of times, and then the pain in my head totally disappeared. I have the feeling that saddened me slightly. The strange gave way to the mundane. “Was there even anything there?” I thought. “Or is this some psychological mechanism for coping with the sensory deprivation, caused by staring at monitors all day?” 

Pretty soon, I was having dinner with my mother (yes, I still live with my parents, I know, very funny). She asked me how did my day go, and I tried to structure the story that I had just experienced in a way that would't make the story sound made up.

>{.note} you are most unable to take notes, at the precise time when it is most appropriate for you to make notes.

She responded with a well-executed silence (I don't know why she always accuses me of not responding to any of the things she says, when it is obvious that she does the exact same thing). I knew that I had to keep talking if I wanted to hear some comment from her and so I kept talking till she stopped me.

"Well, that's interesting, but you seem tired, dear, try to go to bed early."

And then my father took the word:

"Forget that, tell me how did work go?"

For some time this was the only topic he (my father) was interested in
