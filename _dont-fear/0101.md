Pretty soon, I was having dinner with my mother (yes, I still live with my parents, I know, very funny). She asked me how did my day go, and I tried to structure the story that I had just experienced in a way that would't make the story sound made up.

>{.note} you are most unable to take notes, at the precise time when it is most appropriate for you to make notes.

She responded with a well-executed silence (I don't know why she always accuses me of not responding to any of the things she says, when it is obvious that she does the exact same thing). I knew that I had to keep talking if I wanted to hear some comment from her and so I kept talking.

"Well, that's interesting. You seem tired, dear, try to go to bed early."
