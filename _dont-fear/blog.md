so, i got some job, a good job in comparison with most of the jobs today – no big deal though. i just hate those bastards that get some lousy jobs just for their friends to say “wow” and to write those damn blog entries about what they did today in the office. do you notice how my style of writing resembles Salinger’s in “the catcher in the rye” btw, i just finished it (very good book but the end is a little weaker than the rest of the book). so i dont have much to do as you probably can guess, i dont understand how can people can be so stupid. In order to make the average man to complete some task you must lock him in an office – a place without any kind of amusement, hold him there for eight hours without letting him out except for lunch and watch him in not to start playing minesweeper or something. people like me, who do some things, who work just for the hell of it are irrelevant in offices like the one i’m in now. my colleagues use every second to rest a little, i don’t like resting in my workplace.

Fuck that, i do more work when im at home.


according to the majority of people i live a normal life

but my life doesnt satisfy me

i want out!

-1- i h8 exclamation marks and their corresponding emotions. ive probably used it five or six times in my life!

-2- i have extremely high self confidence combined with bursts of fear.

-3- my baby teeth were black.

-4- i produce music, write poetry and prose (as you no doubt know) i drink and smoke joint in my spare time and consider graphic design my “hobby”.

-5- check the blog’s title.



she’s lying on her stomach- im lying on her.
lately the only thing that keeps me calm is a good fuck.
i was sweaty as hell when i finished
she turned around and smiled.
i didnt understand:

-what…?
-5 minutes.
-5 minutes what?
-we had sex for 5 minutes.

when i looked at the clock i realized she was right.
id never finished so quickly
it was good sex, though.
she concluded the dialogue with smth like
“see how many things you can do for 5 minutes!”


a few years ago people used word like “funny” and “strange” to describe me. it used to piss me off. i changed my appearance and behaviour a little and became more acceptable. im now more mainstream type of person. come to think of it, the prevous situation wasnt so bad but on the other hand everyone needs to be accepted and appreciated. and me too. there i said it. lookin back i realize that i’ve been acting awkward on purpose. as some kind of my presonal protest which continues even now, when im a normal-lookin guy. dont make the mistake of thinkin that because my conclusion is the same as other person’s that my reasoning is the same…


most people…suck. but thats not the point. i wanted to make an exclamation about the cognitive mania regarding owning more and more and getting bigger and bigger. normal? normal for a child. to be precise a child of the western culture. i dont find anything cool in large size and quantity:

its hard for you to carry your stuff,
you are like a ship carrying water
besides
too much is never enough
there are many people who are bigger and own more which means they are superior to you. or are they?
are Lolo Ferarry’s boobs nice? and is she?
you want a bigger dick for heart’s sake.
you are easily manipulated.
you need a sophisticated taste to determine the best. even the stupidest lad can easily see the biggest.
sadly in most cases the biggest sucks.
for example the world trade center.
now back on the subject:
you earn more money to be bigger and want to be bigger to earn more money. thats and end itself.
large quantity of either gold or shit sucks.
in conclusion, i will never shut the blog down because of the number of visitors. i like my audience the way it is. its the people that read you not their number or size.



imagine you had just one day in this world,
starting with some hot milk and ending with the last cigarette
work eight hours and than you rest
and remember the good old minutes.

but this day is revealed
it is the same as all other days.
i dont want to live like that
and cross the same streets every day.

and i dont like the life i live
it doesnt suit my fuckin taste
but i dont even know
if there is other…



he is the boyfriend of a colleague of mine, studies pharmacy or something. i ve seen him many times, idle talking in some womanish-lookin pubs with her and her girlfriends… a plump, homely fellow. actually he is silent most of the time, he just smiles and drops short lines from time to time to maintain contact with them and answers the stupid questions they ask him, again to maintain contact with him.

yesterday i saw my coleague holding a helmet. apparently the above individual had bought a motorcycle. a sport bike to be exact. questions crossed my mind: why do you need that machine? how do you combine it with a not particularly attractive girlfriend and a dull job?, but there’s no point askin’. there are many people who dont like their lives. there are fellows that spend their whole life copying others. biting is like sex- everybody’s doin it. but as my grandfather used to say “if in a brothel things arent going good you dont change the beds, you change the whores.” when things aren’t going good with your life better focus on the real issues. dont break your bones with motorcycles- better start with drugs. moreover getting it aint gonna be hard if you study pharmacy.

just stop or one day when you take a look at the mirror and realize you’re showin off in front of yourself.

by the way i dont feel sympathy.




this is a song for you, girl

i call you “girl” although we fuck whenever possible

cause you make me feel like the boy

which i left behind before i had the time and mind to look back

dont have to thank me by huggin and smilin

though,at this moment i think i’ll disintegrate if you don’t do that

just pay attention

i told you this song is for you so shut up and listen



before i met you

i was just a man who didn’t give a flying fuck

now observe

i cant write a song for you without mentioning myself

dont even got a think to say

i said what i wanted enough times in enough ways

this is just a symbol

i just wanted to drop some lines which are for you only




im stronger than most people.

and i’m not statin this because i crave for attention, or i wanna hide my low self esteem.

i just dont like to hide my ego. dont like to build walls around me because i’m not ashamed of what i am.  so i’m telling ya, if you are ashamed of yourself you’re in deep shit.  i see a lot of people who seem to behave like machines. with  mechanism that protects them from the world. but as a look throught their eyes i see that inside they are like cocoons. like  nothing.

so let me tell you little something. i’ll rip your mechanism, cos i can. i’ll dig a hole in your wall and kill you by exposing you to the real world.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil
