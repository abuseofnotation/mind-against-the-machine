Work is an alternative reality---there are people whom I know at work, whom I don't know in my real life. Activities, hierarchies, various customs that only apply to this world that I inhabit 8 hours a day before I exit it and we go on with my live, while trying to make sense of it... or not. 

Some people try to blend work and real life. Or rather have their life get taken over by their job, as the reverse isn't permitted. These people are effectively giving up their identity in favour of their role as an employee. This probably costs them a lot, and I am sure they suffer (although they seem quite happy) but at least it makes the whole thing less hard to deal with, then, ahem... cases like mine. 

But there were other weird cases as well: the next day after having this talk with Anhela, I had an encounter with a colleague of mine called Mirko. Besides colleague, he was a former classmate of mine, so I knew him from school and ever since then he was a brilliant mathematician, a brilliant computer scientist. Yes, and a huge nerd. Now, in parallel to working here, he was also studying in university---something which I also had on my list to do. Mirko on the other hand didn't have time for making friends (although I am not sure he had it on it's list).

Hey!
{: .voice-snowball}

I heard Mirko's childlike voice and saw him coming towards me in his usual lumpy walk, due to which we called him "Snowball" at school (because when he walked he looked like a snowman who is rolling his lower snowball... nevermind). 

"Nice to see you! What are you up to?"
{: .voice-x}

I said, and I really felt nice (although meshing my work life with my personal life usually made me nervous).

Of course, He came to talk about work. Mirko would never came to me for any other reason. He came and started briefing me about the situation he is in with his current project. The whole story was very convoluted and I was absent-mindedly waiting to hear when they would start telling me about how all this was related to the stuff I was working on. But this moment never came. After a couple of minutes he stopped talking and looked at me, as if he anticipated a response, but I really didn't know what to say.

I said that it sounded like his options are either to do A or do B (details omitted). He nodded. Then, I said that the upsides of A are such and such. And the upsides of B are such and such. He nodded again, as if , again, he was anticipating a response.

"What you want me to say?"
{: .voice-x}

"Tell me which one?"
{: .voice-mirko}

For a second I felt great, but then my pride because Mirko is asking for my opinion, was overshadowed by my the fear which my critical thinking facility always triggered when faced with something it doesn't fully grasp. I told him to do what he thinks is more appropriate and went outside to catch a breath of fresh air. I walked to the terrace with a view from Vitosha. I observed the mountain carefully, not fully admitting to myself that I was searching for a new phenomenon. There was no such thing. I wrote this while I was there:

New day, new mountain
And I am still there looking for
that old thrill.
{: .haiku}

While I was there resting I had a similarly-weird encounter with another colleague of mine who hated me, or at least wasn't a fan. She came to me and started making smalltalk, which was so clumsy that I won't try to write it up---if I do, it would consist of mostly Erm's and Mhm's followed by ellipsis. 

I was wondering whether reality (or THAT PARTICULAR reality) completely broke, but soon I discovered the real reason for all this. It was when that colleague finished the conversation and she said "I am happy for you."

People had found out I was being promoted.

And Mirko was assigned in my team.

Suddenly, everyone's attitude towards me had changed --- some people who didn't care about me suddenly started liking me (and some people with whom I previously talked abruptly stopped liking me), but the biggest difference was that I was no longer an outsider.

This is when I realized that I never WANTED to be an outsider. I never wanted to be socially awkward. Quite the contrary, being with other people was a fundamental goal that I had (unconsciously) had pursued since I was little. This was valid even when it comes to people whom I didn't particularly fancy---I was, and still am egalitarian (and so was Anton, by the way). And my whole childhood, all those obscure interests, all those weird things that I did, all this longing for the unconventional, all this were just attempts to start a conversation with someone. My only goal with buying t-shirts of bands that noone knew was for the pretty girl from the other class to come and ask me what the hell is this weird unreadable logo. But I would have never admit it to anyone, not to her, and not even to my own stupid head---I just feared rejection too much. As every person who doesn't believe in themselves, I was just to constrained by only operating in the framework of what I thought was possible.

Even now, when suddenly the things that were possible suddently changed, it was very hard for me to confess to myself that I actually craved for attention (after being, for so many years deprived of it). It took time for me to accept that rather than an artful introvert that I imagined myself as, who had mastered the art of avoiding and of being avoided, I was just a very unsuccessful extrovert. 

Later I'd come to realize that neither of these descriptions captured the full picture.
