The next day I woke up to a hundred messages from Anton, regarding the phenomenon and it's possible causes and meanings, and I convinced myself again that Anton wasn't as lazy as most people thought. His strength was like the electrical energy stored in lightning, which could solve all the world's energy problems, but is so powerful and untamed that no one has the resources to harness it. When an idea possessed him, Anton was able to handle the hammer and nails as well as the computer. He built entire mountains in seconds, as if every detail was planned in his head, regardless of the knowledge and skills required to make it. And when he didn't have that knowledge, he flipped through the pages of books like money-counting machines flip through banknotes, and processed huge amounts of information in seconds.

The myth of his laziness was probably a consequence of the wrong idea about him that his mother, his relatives, and so on had. Here's how they reasoned: "A person with Anton's abilities could with minimal effort complete higher education, start a serious job, and in general do all those things that are expected of him. But he doesn't do it despite that, therefore he must be very lazy." And here's what they missed: a person with great abilities (and hence with great self-confidence) also needed great stimuli. And as a result, Anton couldn't do something just because it was expected of him. On some days, he didn't even have the strength to get out of bed if he didn't find a good enough reason to do so. And for him, those reasons were few and in most cases fleeting.

That's why my friend led this self-destructive lifestyle I've been describing so far. This was the lifestyle that corresponded to the side of his character that most people knew. The loud, angry side, the drinking, and staying up late side, which filled its time with aimless loafing. Anton himself didn't like it and tried to overcome it, for which purpose he went through all sorts of sciences, arts, and philosophies, in search of things that would engage his restless mind. And for some reason, such a thing in this case was the Phenomenon.

I understood Anton well because I was also, like him, felt sad most of the time, although we were also quite different in how we handled our situation: my misery was hard to bear, but never crushing, it was dark, but never pitch black and I was always able to look away and distract myself, to lose the constraints that my feelings imposed upon me. In short, my world was not a world of DARKNESS but one of FOG. For that reason, my desire to get away was strong but formless, I constantly kept losing my way, I was often amids two or three different things, never without a path, but also never actually following one.

I travelled to the office on autopilot. When I entered the room, I noticed that my boss was smiling at me, but I preferred not to talk to her, so I excused myself and hid behind my monitors and started answering my messages. I decided to call Anton, because reading everything he had written would take me longer. He was much more enthusiastic than me, although he surely didn't sleep:

"I combed through half the Internet while looking for witness accounts of the other beam." He spoke with an inflamed tone, as if deliberately wanting to hide how excited he had been of the events he was telling about. "When I didn't find anything, I started interrogating all acquaintances and strangers in the city. I spent hours non-stop communicating with people, half of whom decided I was completely crazy... Anyway... In the end, an old girlfriend wrote to me. She claims that some neighbor of hers had experienced something similar to what you did. Now we'll check if that's really true..."

I promised them we would do that sometimes and moved on with my work messages: the CEO of the company had written a memo on the importance of the task from yesterday, saying that everyone should take a look at it, and suggest how can we solve it. I read it and I opened my code from yesterday.

Like I said, I was always in the middle of many conflicting things, and this morning was not an exception --- there were two cases, two PLOTS, if you will---the investigation of the phenomenon, and my ambition to become financially independent. But none of these were being resolved anytime soon. I didn't even know which should be the main one. 

"Or perhaps there needen't be a main plot," Yes, perhaps I ought to find time to both look at Anton's messages and do something at work. But then I quickly realized that I couldn't do both of these things.

"So, I guess THE PHENOMENON was the main plot?" That was certainly right, according to Anton's viewpoint, and would make a better book. But would it would take me to where I want to go? Or was chasing the phenomenon be an extension of the road that I had always been following, the same one which took me to the place I was then: tired, miserable and essentially roadless... 

Or was this about my future CAREER, which will allow me to get away from the situation with my parents... and give me something to do? Was this the point where I am done chasing ephemeral things and I decide to dedicate my life to the art, craft and science of programming?

Or perhaps (this is really solid book material) the two were CONNECTED?

My thoughts suddenly returned to my first encounter with the Phenomenon. Unknown. But wasn't I there... In a human brain. Its essence was in front of me. If I tried to describe it in a programming language.... Maybe I could...

My fingers themselves touched the keyboard. The pain returned, but this time it was so light I felt it almost like an itch, which not only didn't bother me but even helped me concentrate. I didn't fully understand what I was writing. The meaning of the individual lines escaped me, and the standard brain processes that traditionally accompanied work had taken a back seat. With them, the fear of failure also disappeared. I was already sure that this day would end interestingly.

My hands moved faster and faster, so I couldn't even follow which keys I was pressing, and I got more and more confused in my attempts to follow my own logic, until finally I lost it completely. All that remained was to wait until the work was finished.

After about an hour, I began to gradually regain control. It became more and more difficult to translate my thoughts, and I began to miss words and entire commands, but by the time I started thinking consciously, and consequently making mistakes, the main work was already done. All that remained was to write a few additional things, which were elementary compared to what I had done so far. I leaned back and reviewed my work from beginning to end. The code was written in my style, there was no doubt about that, but it was many times more perfect than the junk that usually came out of my hands. For twenty minutes, I just browsed aimlessly through it to see where I could add something. There wasn't any. I took a breath and loaded the file into the test machine.




"Okay, and where exactly does she live?"

**NOTE:** "Pay more attention to details."

For half an hour we wandered around this neighborhood, where I had never set foot before. Then we got out of the car and started walking around the neighborhood, playing "Spot the Ten Differences" with the absolutely identical apartment blocks, which created a feeling of lack of movement—wherever we turned we saw the same thing, as if we were sailors traveling the open ocean.

At one point, Anton stopped and fixed his gaze on an inscription scratched next to one of the entrances.
"This is it." He said.

The inscription read:

**A + T**

Where "T" was the girl we were supposed to meet (Tina, or Tony, I don't remember now), and "A" naturally was Anton. I laughed and nudged him on the shoulder, but he wasn't amused. Before entering, he hinted to me that he didn't want to spend much time with this girl.
"Why do you never like your old girlfriends?" I asked.
"Because I don't like myself." He replied, while pressing the doorbell.

Anton's ex-girlfriend definitely didn't share his antipathy. She threw herself on him and hugged him so tightly that he couldn't break free from her:
"Long time no see, sweetie!"

She: dark skin, light hair, and charming face. Her figure had perfect proportions, and the only thing that distinguished her from the models who posed for magazines was her height—she was a bit larger than normal. Dressed in a silk nightgown and flip-flops. Apparently, she had just gotten out of bed, but despite that, she hadn't wiped off the thick line of black pencil from her eyes, which (at least I think), she had put on only because she knew she was about to meet Anton.

I had to rescue him from her by playing the role of the bad cop, which he had assigned me.
"You'll see each other later." I said. "We're here on a completely different matter."
"Sorry." The girl said.
"Who is the man?"
"Bonchev. Upstairs, one door over."


The pain made me close my eyes and scream. For a moment everything disappeared again (which made me feel calmer). My next memory was of us leaving the apartment. I felt the hand of the Curious One, who had grabbed me around the waist and was dragging me down the stairs. Then one of the doors on the staircase opened—someone had heard us:
"Hey, Curious! What happened to your friend?" I recognized the voice of the girl we had talked to a little while ago.
"Nothing's wrong with him! We're leaving now!"
"But where are you taking him?" She continued. "Stop for a moment! What happened upstairs? Curious!"

He stopped and turned to her:
"Lily, don't you remember my real name?"
"Well..." She sounded extremely worried. "Well, right now..."
"Great!" Anton turned his back on her and continued down.

At his place, he cleared the couch in the large room by pushing everything off it onto the floor, and laid me on it. In the following hours, I lost consciousness and woke up at regular intervals, at one point apparently starting to beg him to call a doctor, quite insistently.
"And what do you think that doctor will tell you? At most he'll prescribe you some sedatives, which, the same sedatives, I can give you too. But you don't need them. You'll recover on your own."

And for some reason, he was sure I would recover on my own.

For a few hours, I wandered in a sleepless nightmare, and during that time I understood that the pain I was experiencing was directly connected to the state of my brain. Thoughts of the Phenomenon seemed to cause the neurons in my brain to swell and pour onto the pain receptors, so the pain became stronger. Therefore, I needed something to distract me from these thoughts. I turned on the room lamp. My gaze fell on the Bible, which was still on the table, stained with red wine. I dragged myself to it and even while dizzy and half asleep, opened the first page:

And God said: Let there be light.
And there was light.
And God saw that the light was good;

After these few lines, the pain subsided. I had the strength to stand up, after which I grabbed the book like a diabetic injecting himself with insulin.

and God separated the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day,
and the darkness he called Night.

The pain disappeared completely. Amazed, I went through this passage several times searching for the reason why it affected me like this.

"What nonsense!" I thought, dazed.
"If it's nonsense, why are you reading it?"
"Because I need them?" I said. "I just need them."
"Well, you should have studied theology, little Engineer!" I turned and saw Anton behind me.
"What? I came to see how you were... And I find you reading the Bible..."
"It can stop the pain." I said.

He laughed, as if I had told him a killer joke.
"I think it's quite ironic how we're built." He said. "Every mystery makes us feel awful. But when we get some explanation for it, no matter how stupid it is, we immediately calm down."





After a while, Anton grumbled that he was hungry and asked me to help him prepare dinner. We agreed to eat in the house's dining room—a beautifully arranged room we had never used before because it was always too messy. But now that there weren't so many people in the house (the tenants still appeared sporadically, but they also obviously realized that the days of continuous partying were over), we could afford the luxury of using it.

From there, we threw out the old dirty oilcloth that covered the table, and in its place put a clean white tablecloth. The Curious One stepped back a little, looked over the new arrangement, and satisfied with the result, went to prepare the food—he took a few potatoes out of the fridge, cut them without peeling them, and put them in the fryer. He also took two chicken cutlets, which had previously been swimming in a large pot with marinade.

The two of us started setting the table: we spread the tablecloth and began arranging plates and glasses. We also took out the silverware that had been sitting in the sideboard of said dining room ever since we moved in here. I made a trip to the fridge and came back with some semi-finished dessert, which I placed in the middle of the table. Anton immediately went to the silverware drawer and returned with two small dessert spoons. This gesture inspired him and he headed to the living room, from where he returned with an unfinished bottle of white wine (at least that doesn't go bad). For it, we washed two glasses with stems, which we also found in the sideboard, and placed each of these items carefully, as if preparing a movie set. When we finished, the cutlets and fries were just done, so I poured them onto plates and sat at the table, waiting for Anton to follow. He, however, was staring at the ceiling and wandering aimlessly around the room. I called him several times, but he didn't answer. I could already sense he was pondering something. I didn't want to bother him, so I decided to wait a little more...
"You know what?" He finally said. "However dangerous it is, I want to go back there. To see what Bonchev saw."




And the image of the superman, described by Nietzsche, is one of the greatest myths of the 20th century. The heroes of Ayn Rand, who never doubt themselves and their goals, are also a myth. Because fanatics and careerists will never have abilities that can match their self-confidence. The true striving for self-improvement does not come from an ambition to be better, but from the realization of how pitiful we actually are. And true understanding is nothing other than reverence for that which we cannot...
