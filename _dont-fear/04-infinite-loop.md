The next day I woke up to a hundred messages from Anton, regarding the phenomenon and it's possible causes and meanings, and I convinced myself again that Anton wasn't as lazy as most people thought. His strength was like the electrical energy stored in lightning, which could solve all the world's energy problems, but is so powerful and untamed that no one has the resources to harness it. When an idea possessed him, Anton was able to handle the hammer and nails as well as the computer. He built entire mountains in seconds, as if every detail was planned in his head, regardless of the knowledge and skills required to make it. And when he didn't have that knowledge, he flipped through the pages of books like money-counting machines flip through banknotes, and processed huge amounts of information in seconds.

The myth of his laziness was probably a consequence of the wrong idea about him that his mother, his relatives, and so on had. Here's how they reasoned: "A person with Anton's abilities could with minimal effort complete higher education, start a serious job, and in general do all those things that are expected of him. But he doesn't do it despite that, therefore he must be very lazy." And here's what they missed: a person with great abilities (and hence with great self-confidence) also needed great stimuli. And as a result, Anton couldn't do something just because it was expected of him. On some days, he didn't even have the strength to get out of bed if he didn't find a good enough reason to do so. And for him, those reasons were few and in most cases fleeting.

That's why my friend led this self-destructive lifestyle I've been describing so far. This was the lifestyle that corresponded to the side of his character that most people knew. The loud, angry side, the drinking, and staying up late side, which filled its time with aimless loafing. Anton himself didn't like it and tried to overcome it, for which purpose he went through all sorts of sciences, arts, and philosophies, in search of things that would engage his restless mind. And for some reason, such a thing in this case was the Phenomenon.

I understood Anton well because I was also, like him, felt sad most of the time, although we were also quite different in how we handled our situation: my misery was hard to bear, but never crushing, it was dark, but never pitch black and I was always able to look away and distract myself, to lose the constraints that my feelings imposed upon me. In short, my world was not a world of DARKNESS but one of FOG.

And my desire to get away from the fog was strong but formless, I constantly kept losing my way, was often amids two or three different things, never without a path, but also never actually following one. 

This can be confirmed by my current state: I was in the middle of two cases, two PLOTS, if you will: the investigation of the phenomenon, and my ambition to become financially independent, but none of these were being resolved anytime soon. I didn't even know which should be the main one. 

So, 

The fact was that I neither wanted to look at Anton's messages, nor I wanted to do something at work.

"I combed through half the Internet while looking for witness accounts of the other beam." He spoke with an inflamed tone, as if deliberately wanting to hide how excited he had been during the events he was telling about. "When I didn't find anything, I started interrogating all acquaintances and strangers in the city. I spent over eight hours non-stop communicating with people, half of whom decided I was completely crazy... Anyway... In the end, an old girlfriend wrote to me. She claims that some neighbor of hers had experienced something similar to what you did. Now we'll check if that's really true."
"Okay, and where exactly does she live?"

**NOTE:** "Pay more attention to details."

For half an hour we wandered around this neighborhood, where I had never set foot before. Then we got out of the car and started walking around the neighborhood, playing "Spot the Ten Differences" with the absolutely identical apartment blocks, which created a feeling of lack of movement—wherever we turned we saw the same thing, as if we were sailors traveling the open ocean.

At one point, Anton stopped and fixed his gaze on an inscription scratched next to one of the entrances.
"This is it." He said.

The inscription read:

**A + T**

Where "T" was the girl we were supposed to meet (Tina, or Tony, I don't remember now), and "A" naturally was Anton. I laughed and nudged him on the shoulder, but he wasn't amused. Before entering, he hinted to me that he didn't want to spend much time with this girl.
"Why do you never like your old girlfriends?" I asked.
"Because I don't like myself." He replied, while pressing the doorbell.

Anton's ex-girlfriend definitely didn't share his antipathy. She threw herself on him and hugged him so tightly that he couldn't break free from her:
"Long time no see, sweetie!"

She: dark skin, light hair, and charming face. Her figure had perfect proportions, and the only thing that distinguished her from the models who posed for magazines was her height—she was a bit larger than normal. Dressed in a silk nightgown and flip-flops. Apparently, she had just gotten out of bed, but despite that, she hadn't wiped off the thick line of black pencil from her eyes, which (at least I think), she had put on only because she knew she was about to meet Anton.

I had to rescue him from her by playing the role of the bad cop, which he had assigned me.
"You'll see each other later." I said. "We're here on a completely different matter."
"Sorry." The girl said.
"Who is the man?"
"Bonchev. Upstairs, one door over."

I urged her to tell us in more detail and she did:
"So, I bumped into him yesterday, more or less at this time. He was terribly nervous and with very poor eyesight. So, he normally sees very well, nothing even though he's elderly, and yesterday I had to show him the way so he could navigate the stairs. And I, like, very worried: 'What happened to you? Will you be okay?' and he: 'Eyes cannot look at light for too long.' From there on, he started telling some super strange story, about some light coming from space... How he had gone to see it up close, it had directed itself towards him. And then it started illuminating the interior of all machines. He could see how the current passed through those..."
"Integrated circuits."
"...and for a moment he saw the whole world, which also functioned like a machine. The supply of raw materials, their use for production, and blah-blah... Ugh..." She looked embarrassed. "He didn't finish telling me what happened to him. Said he had important work and had to get back quickly. Oh, and one more thing—in his hand he was holding an empty shopping bag. I don't know where he had been. And I didn't understand most of the things he said... The Curious One knows I'm not famous for particular intellect."
"One important question." The Curious One spoke for the first time.
"What's the chance that he made these things up? That they were hallucinations, if you will?"
"Pardon?" I was surprised.
"Sorry, little Engineer. I just want to be sure..."
"None." The girl said. "He is a very straightforward person. Has a professorial title, in his time he was chairman of a scientific council. And his memory... His brain is like a real computer... For example in the supermarket across... I mean, because sometimes we bump into each other there. And he even if he's buying, for example, twenty different things, just by looking at them he knows exactly..."

The girl started to chatter and Anton signaled me to interrupt her:
"Okay, you'll tell us later!" I said. "We need to see your neighbor before he goes to bed."

She quickly said goodbye to us and closed the door.

As we headed upstairs, I began to remember that severe headache from the time of my encounter with the beam. I had experienced it only once in my life and hoped it would remain that way. Just hoped. It reappeared and increased with every step we climbed, bringing us closer to the other witness of the Phenomenon.

"What's wrong, little Engineer?"
"We're on the right track." I said, while massaging my temples. I was so bad that the Curious One almost dragged me to the door. He pressed the doorbell. No one opened.
"Maybe he's not home?" I said.
"Nonsense! Where else could an elderly person be at ten in the evening?" The Curious One grabbed the door handle and shook it, causing the lock's bolt to start rattling. "Nowhere!"
"So he doesn't want to be disturbed..."
"But he also hasn't secured himself very much."

He stepped back a few paces from the door, then took a run and slammed into it with his body. The twenty-year-old lock instantly broke off, making us punishable on charges of breaking and entering.
"What the hell are you doing?" I yelled at Anton as he entered.

Then I followed him.

**NOTE:** "Consider your actions before, not after you do them."

The interior of the place gave a satisfactory answer to the question of why Bonchev hadn't installed a bigger lock—there was nothing valuable in the room. Actually, almost nothing at all. The floor was covered only with a dusty blanket, which substituted for a carpet. The role of furniture was played by several hastily constructed wooden structures, which were so rough it was hard to distinguish the chair from the table. And most of the things were stored in nylon bags nailed to the walls. The only thing that hinted at what kind of person lived in the apartment were the mountains of blueprints scattered throughout the entire apartment. I picked up one of them to look at it closely.

"Here it is!" Anton exclaimed. "Under the blueprint was the shopping bag his ex-girlfriend had mentioned."
"Mr. Bonchev, we just want to talk to you." He continued to yell (apparently not realizing that in most cases this remark was perceived with the exact opposite meaning of what he wanted to express).

I got curious and took the shopping bag, but it really seemed empty, and before I had a chance to make sure, I heard the voice of the Curious One, who was screaming at me from the other room:
"Little Engineer!"
"Did you find him?" I asked. I hoped we'd finish this faster because I had an increasingly unpleasant feeling.
"Yes. But he..."
"What's wrong with him?"
"He won't answer our questions."
"Pardon?"
"He won't answer anyone's questions..."

I threw the bag and ran to the bathroom where the voice was coming from. There I saw Bonchev. He was sitting in the bathtub completely naked, and the water had already turned red from the blood flowing from his slit wrists.
"Should we call an ambulance?" I said.

The Curious One rolled up his sleeves and placed his thumb and forefinger on the man's throat.
"More like a hearse." He replied. "But for now, you're not calling anyone!"
"And the police?"
"And what are you going to tell them?"
"I don't know..." The world spun around me.

And not just because of the sight—the headache was returning.
"We'll search the place thoroughly." Anton said.
"No... not now..." I waved my hand. "We need to get out of here now. I think think that was the last thing I said before I slumped to the floor."

The pain made me close my eyes and scream. For a moment everything disappeared again (which made me feel calmer). My next memory was of us leaving the apartment. I felt the hand of the Curious One, who had grabbed me around the waist and was dragging me down the stairs. Then one of the doors on the staircase opened—someone had heard us:
"Hey, Curious! What happened to your friend?" I recognized the voice of the girl we had talked to a little while ago.
"Nothing's wrong with him! We're leaving now!"
"But where are you taking him?" She continued. "Stop for a moment! What happened upstairs? Curious!"

He stopped and turned to her:
"Lily, don't you remember my real name?"
"Well..." She sounded extremely worried. "Well, right now..."
"Great!" Anton turned his back on her and continued down.

At his place, he cleared the couch in the large room by pushing everything off it onto the floor, and laid me on it. In the following hours, I lost consciousness and woke up at regular intervals, at one point apparently starting to beg him to call a doctor, quite insistently.
"And what do you think that doctor will tell you? At most he'll prescribe you some sedatives, which, the same sedatives, I can give you too. But you don't need them. You'll recover on your own."

And for some reason, he was sure I would recover on my own.

For a few hours, I wandered in a sleepless nightmare, and during that time I understood that the pain I was experiencing was directly connected to the state of my brain. Thoughts of the Phenomenon seemed to cause the neurons in my brain to swell and pour onto the pain receptors, so the pain became stronger. Therefore, I needed something to distract me from these thoughts. I turned on the room lamp. My gaze fell on the Bible, which was still on the table, stained with red wine. I dragged myself to it and even while dizzy and half asleep, opened the first page:

And God said: Let there be light.
And there was light.
And God saw that the light was good;

After these few lines, the pain subsided. I had the strength to stand up, after which I grabbed the book like a diabetic injecting himself with insulin.

and God separated the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day,
and the darkness he called Night.

The pain disappeared completely. Amazed, I went through this passage several times searching for the reason why it affected me like this.

"What nonsense!" I thought, dazed.
"If it's nonsense, why are you reading it?"
"Because I need them?" I said. "I just need them."
"Well, you should have studied theology, little Engineer!" I turned and saw Anton behind me.
"What? I came to see how you were... And I find you reading the Bible..."
"It can stop the pain." I said.

He laughed, as if I had told him a killer joke.
"I think it's quite ironic how we're built." He said. "Every mystery makes us feel awful. But when we get some explanation for it, no matter how stupid it is, we immediately calm down."









My thoughts suddenly returned to my first encounter with the Phenomenon. Unknown. But wasn't I there... In a human brain. Its essence was in front of me. If I tried to describe it in a programming language.... Maybe I could...

My fingers themselves touched the keyboard. The pain returned, but this time it was so light I felt it almost like an itch, which not only didn't bother me but even helped me concentrate. I didn't fully understand what I was writing. The meaning of the individual lines escaped me, and the standard brain processes that traditionally accompanied work had taken a back seat. With them, the fear of failure also disappeared, and I was already sure that this afternoon would end interestingly.

My hands moved faster and faster, so I couldn't even follow which keys I was pressing, and I got more and more confused in my attempts to follow my own logic, until finally I lost it completely. All that remained was to wait until the work was finished.

After about an hour, I began to gradually regain control. It became more and more difficult to translate my thoughts, and I began to miss words and entire commands, but by the time I started thinking consciously, and consequently making mistakes, the main work was already done. All that remained was to write a few additional things, which were elementary compared to what I had done so far. I leaned back and reviewed my work from beginning to end. The code was written in my style, there was no doubt about that, but it was many times more perfect than the junk that usually came out of my hands. For twenty minutes, I just browsed aimlessly through it to see where I could add something. There wasn't any. I took a breath and loaded the file into the test machine.








After a while, Anton grumbled that he was hungry and asked me to help him prepare dinner. We agreed to eat in the house's dining room—a beautifully arranged room we had never used before because it was always too messy. But now that there weren't so many people in the house (the tenants still appeared sporadically, but they also obviously realized that the days of continuous partying were over), we could afford the luxury of using it.

From there, we threw out the old dirty oilcloth that covered the table, and in its place put a clean white tablecloth. The Curious One stepped back a little, looked over the new arrangement, and satisfied with the result, went to prepare the food—he took a few potatoes out of the fridge, cut them without peeling them, and put them in the fryer. He also took two chicken cutlets, which had previously been swimming in a large pot with marinade.

The two of us started setting the table: we spread the tablecloth and began arranging plates and glasses. We also took out the silverware that had been sitting in the sideboard of said dining room ever since we moved in here. I made a trip to the fridge and came back with some semi-finished dessert, which I placed in the middle of the table. Anton immediately went to the silverware drawer and returned with two small dessert spoons. This gesture inspired him and he headed to the living room, from where he returned with an unfinished bottle of white wine (at least that doesn't go bad). For it, we washed two glasses with stems, which we also found in the sideboard, and placed each of these items carefully, as if preparing a movie set. When we finished, the cutlets and fries were just done, so I poured them onto plates and sat at the table, waiting for Anton to follow. He, however, was staring at the ceiling and wandering aimlessly around the room. I called him several times, but he didn't answer. I could already sense he was pondering something. I didn't want to bother him, so I decided to wait a little more...
"You know what?" He finally said. "However dangerous it is, I want to go back there. To see what Bonchev saw."




And the image of the superman, described by Nietzsche, is one of the greatest myths of the 20th century. The heroes of Ayn Rand, who never doubt themselves and their goals, are also a myth. Because fanatics and careerists will never have abilities that can match their self-confidence. The true striving for self-improvement does not come from an ambition to be better, but from the realization of how pitiful we actually are. And true understanding is nothing other than reverence for that which we cannot...
