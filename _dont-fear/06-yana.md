"Okay, and where exactly does she live?"

Pay more attention to details.

For an hour we wandered around this neighborhood, where I had never set foot before, playing a game of "Spot the Ten Differences" between the absolutely identical apartment blocks, which created a feeling of lack of movement—wherever we turned we saw the same thing, as if we were sailors traveling the open ocean. 

At one point, Anton stopped and fixed his gaze on an inscription scratched next to one of the entrances.

"This is it." He said.

The inscription read:

**A + T**
{: .inscription}

Where "T" was the girl we were supposed to meet (Tina, or Tony, I don't remember now), and "A" naturally was Anton. I laughed and nudged him on the shoulder, but he wasn't amused. Before entering, he hinted to me that he didn't want to spend much time with this girl.

"Why do you never like your old girlfriends?" I asked.

"Because I don't like myself." He replied, while pressing the doorbell.

Anton's ex-girlfriend definitely didn't share his antipathy. She threw herself on him and hugged him so tightly that he couldn't break free from her. She: dark skin, light hair, and charming face. Her figure had perfect proportions, and the only thing that distinguished her from the models who posed for magazines was her height—she was a bit larger than normal. Dressed in a silk nightgown and flip-flops. Apparently, she had just gotten out of bed, but despite that, she hadn't wiped off the thick line of black pencil from her eyes, which (at least I think), she had put on only because she knew she was about to meet Anton.

She invited us

She I had to rescue him from her by playing the role of the bad cop, which he had assigned me.

"You'll see each other later." I said. "We're here on a completely different matter."

I urged her to tell us in more detail and she did:

"So, I bumped into him yesterday, more or less at this time. He was terribly nervous and with very poor eyesight. So, he normally sees very well, nothing even though he's elderly, and yesterday I had to show him the way so he could navigate the stairs. And I, like, very worried: 'What happened to you? Will you be okay?' and he: 'Eyes cannot look at light for too long.' From there on, he started telling some super strange story, about some light coming from space... How he had gone to see it up close, it had directed itself towards him. And then it started illuminating the interior of all machines. He could see how the current passed through those..."
"Integrated circuits."

"...and for a moment he saw the whole world, which also functioned like a machine. The supply of raw materials, their use for production, and blah-blah... Ugh..." She looked embarrassed. "He didn't finish telling me what happened to him. Said he had important work and had to get back quickly. Oh, and one more thing—in his hand he was holding an empty shopping bag. I don't know where he had been. And I didn't understand most of the things he said... Curious knows I'm not famous for particular intellect."

"One important question." The Curious One spoke for the first time.

"What's the chance that he made these things up? That they were hallucinations, if you will?"

"Pardon?" I was surprised.

"Sorry, little Engineer. I just want to be sure..."

"None." The girl said. "He is a very straightforward person. Has a professorial title, in his time he was chairman of a scientific council. And his memory... His brain is like a real computer... For example in the supermarket across... I mean, because sometimes we bump into each other there. And he even if he's buying, for example, twenty different things, just by looking at them he knows exactly..."

The girl started to chatter and Anton signaled me to interrupt her:
"Okay, you'll tell us later!" I said. "We need to see your neighbor before he goes to bed."

She quickly said goodbye to us and closed the door.

As we headed upstairs, I began to remember that severe headache from the time of my encounter with the beam. I had experienced it only once in my life and hoped it would remain that way. Just hoped. It reappeared and increased with every step we climbed, bringing us closer to the other witness of the Phenomenon.


The pain made me close my eyes and scream. For a moment everything disappeared again (which made me feel calmer). My next memory was of us leaving the apartment. I felt the hand of the Curious One, who had grabbed me around the waist and was dragging me down the stairs. Then one of the doors on the staircase opened—someone had heard us:
"Hey, Curious! What happened to your friend?" I recognized the voice of the girl we had talked to a little while ago.
"Nothing's wrong with him! We're leaving now!"
"But where are you taking him?" She continued. "Stop for a moment! What happened upstairs? Curious!"

He stopped and turned to her:
"Tina, don't you remember my real name?"
"Well..." She sounded extremely worried. "Well, right now..."
"Great!" Anton turned his back on her and continued down.


I quickly told the Curious One what had happened to me and tried to share my thoughts with him, although they weren't clear even to me:
"...at one point I couldn't control myself anymore. As if then it wasn't me, but something was passing through me and using me. Or I was using it, I have no idea... The best work of my entire career. And it came to nothing... And this guy, Bonchev. I mean, he's dead, really!"
"Maybe we could go along that line.... Apparently there is a connection between you two... Between you and Bonchev, I mean... That you saw it... It could have been anyone: your colleagues, some random passerby... But it's you and him. Why?"
"It's hardly a coincidence." I supported him. "Apparently the Phenomenon in some way PUSHED him to do what he did, in the same way it pushed me to write this program."

Anton frowned:
"You're talking out of your ass with these hasty conclusions... You know, 'After this, not because of this,' and so on, I mean, let's see what we have first..."
"We have a corpse." I hinted, trying to think rationally. "And a suicide for an unknown reason."
"Yes." Anton nodded. "Besides him, we have this program of yours that you wrote..."
"My program is lost." I interrupted him.
"Lost?"
"Yes, it caused an infinite loop."
"Infinite loop?"
"Look it up on Google!" I said. In principle, the concept was interesting and it was always nice to explain it, but then I just couldn't be bothered with anything.

Anton accepted my suggestion. He sat down in front of his computer, pressed a few keys, and his gaze began to roam the screen. He squinted and clicked something with the mouse. And at one point he was extremely surprised, apparently by something he was reading. His eyes widened as if they were about to pop out of their sockets, his lower lip hung to the ground, and only pulled back when he spoke again:
"I have a theory about why Bonchev killed himself."
"Why?"

He covered his mouth with his hand.
"Out of fear."
"Okay, imagine the following..." Anton began to speak. "This Bonchev... Actually, what's his first name? Doesn't matter... He's a scientist. Works his whole life on some construction projects, and accumulates serious knowledge of mathematics and physics. Then he gets retired. Since he has no wife or close people, he decides to devote himself to some of his own research, which gradually fills his entire life."
"How do you know he has no close ones?"
"No one called looking for him in these two days, right?"

So he delves deeply into these researches of his. Maybe he imagines he's on the verge of discovering some incredible theory that explains everything around us. Or maybe he really was, who knows. Suddenly he encounters the Phenomenon, and through it, for a few seconds, realizes that his whole life has been on the wrong path. That these theories of his, which he upheld, and which were for him almost like a religion, were just fiction.
"It's unlikely it happened just like that..."
"Well, at first he didn't believe it." The Curious One continued. "This ties in: he ran to his home to check if he hadn't made a mistake. That's when he bumped into Tina. She helped him get to the apartment. There he had already realized with certainty that what he saw on February 14th really refuted his work and beliefs. Then he got into the bathtub and..."
"But why did he do it?"
"Look, an infinite loop is normal for computer programs." Anton said. "Perhaps a similar process is possible in the human brain." Especially in the brain of an engineer.
"Don't joke."
"I'm not joking at all. Sometimes you guys are so stubborn, like blinkered horses, that nothing can deter you from the goal you've set. Take me for example. I'm stubborn. But if there's something I can't understand, or figure out, after two or three tries I just drop it. I give up. It gets boring."
"And?"

Well, that's normal. To say to yourself: "Well, screw it, I'm sick of dealing with just this thing! The world is huge, I'm not going to sit and butt my head against one little corner all my life, like a damned idiot!" You see, that's like a defense mechanism of the brain against a crash. Like a restart—you drop what's bored you and start something else. But with engineers, this mechanism is screwed up. They are willing to do anything to achieve their goal, or 'meet the conditions' as you programmers say. For example, Bonchev's goal was to understand the world around him. But suddenly the conditions changed and the goal became unachievable. So we come again to the moment when he lies down in the bathtub, takes his razor and...
"And what was this something that he saw? The light?"
"Hardly." The Curious One shrugged.
"So we need to search his apartment..."
"Screw that!" Anton said. "If you want, go, but I personally don't want to see it at all."

He seemed to want to demonstrate with what ease he could give up on everything he didn't succeed with on the second or third try.
"So you're giving up on investigating this, is that it?"
"Well, yeah, I guess. In the sense that I don't want to be found in the bathtub myself, with..."
"But what will we do then?"
"Well, Bonchev is our only lead. So for now, I guess we do nothing."
