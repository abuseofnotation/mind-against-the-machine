    Hi
---

Anton lived in a dilapidated house at the end of the city, which he bought cheaply, because the previous owner had convinced himself it was haunted. I never figured out how he managed to acquire it without any financial help from his parents (his mother worked a miserable job, and his father had been dead for ten years) and at some point I had to settle with the explanation that he is one of those people to whom such things just happen. The rooms of the house he didn’t use, Anton rented out, and as a result the house was always full of people, who were so many, and changed so often that I perceived them as part of the interior, although, once I was one of them. Okay, let me structure my thought a bit:

1.  In school, I didn’t belong to any group, but since I still had to be friends with someone, I hanged out with the other kids who also didn’t belong to any group (especially the more nerdy ones). And one of them was Anton.

2.  Anton really liked asking stupid questions, and as a result, teachers and classmates gave him the nickname "Curious". And since this nickname suited him very well, I still call him that to this day.

3.  After school, Curious bought the said house. Then he decided he had made the deal of his life and went on to become a rentier and spend his free time (that is, all the time) smoking marijuana and drinking.

4. I used to go see him a lot at first, but after a few months, I decided to build a career in the company that I currently work at and because the office was on the other side of Sofia, I systematically got tired from all the travelling and the noise in the house.

5. After a while, I moved back with my parents and little by little lost touch with Curious.

I can’t believe how quickly we had stopped communicating. It seemed to me I hadn’t seen him for months. But interestingly, I headed straight to his house, without calling him to warn him, despite that I didn't know what he was up to: he could have got a girlfriend, gone travelling, found a job (not very likely), but something told me he was still constant in his inconstancy.

As always, the door of the house was open. I entered the huge hall, which occupied almost the entire first floor, and greeted the guys and girls sitting there while trying to shout over the loud music pouring from the shiny “Infinity” speakers -- a legacy from the previous owner.  At the center, a person was lying on the floor. He was unconscious and in his hand he clutched an empty KFC bag.  

“What’s wrong with this guy?”  

Instead of answering me, he and a few of his friends started laughing at my question, and gradually almost all the people in the room joined the laughter (even those who had no idea what it was about). Then, one of them started explaining to me that at the beginning of the evening, the said person had bet with someone else that he could, without a problem...

> Note: “Don’t ask stupid questions, unless you want to hear the stupid answers.”

I looked at the people once more and after not finding anyone I knew, headed toward the back of the room. Curious was there, sitting on a huge armchair. He was wearing a baseball cap  which darkened his whole face, and hid from his gaze everything, except for a thick book on his lap, which he was unfolding so fervently that its pages were tearing at the corners. I stood next to him and said “Hello.” He turned toward me for a second, just to establish my identity, and then buried his nose in the volume again, while simultaneously talking to me:  

“How are you, Engineer. What’s up?”  

“Nothing special.”

> Note: “This question seems to have become redundant.”

I said this as a prelude to the story about the phenomenon, but he took it literally and he immediately took the floor and started telling me an anecdote from the book that he was reading, which was on the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: Apparently, when Wittgenstein was deciding if he wanted to dedicate his life to philosophy, he gave a manuscript of his for review to his mentor Bertrand Russell, and he told him 'Read this and tell me if I am a complete idiot.'

"He was very harsh on himself." I said.

"Yes, but get this. Russell asked him why he wanted that. And he said 'Because if I am not a complete idiot, I will become a philosopher...' Curious made a long pause, '...and if I am one, I will become an engineer!'"

When he said this, we both started laughing. The joke was on me, I was "the Engineer" -- this was my nickname which he gave me when I got accepted to study at the technical university. But it wasn't a mean joke, as it may appear to you -- nothing that Curious said or did was mean. Still, it make me nervous: It (the story) was just a way for us to reconnect with each other, through our high-school personas, which, for good or worse, we haven't moved away from. 

“Anything interesting with you?” --- Anton must have noticed my serious expression as I was thinking of a way to make a fast segue to the phenomenon.

“Yes,” I said, after recovering, “Actually, one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me.”  

“And aren’t you going to tell me what?”  

“I’ll tell you, that’s why I came.”

With this remark, I managed to engage his attention. His gaze stopped roaming the room and focused on me, while I mentally went through the whole experience, trying to systematize the information. But they are drunk and the music is loud, so I realized that none of the things I planned to say would work and I just start screaming 

"So, get this. I go out of the office. I see a ray of light, which looks as if it's coming from space. I get off my car and start running towards it and... and it submerges me. Stop, hear the whole thing! First I start hearing everyone, as if I am God, OK? I am literally flying. Then, in the next moment, I am kinda like stuck in my own brain. and I am thinking. 'what's the point of thinking logically when I cannot get anywhere with it. Like, can I just be free?' Next thing I was laying on the grass!"

He didn’t say anything even after I finished the story. At first, I thought he was reconsidering his answer (another thing he never did) and by the time I realized, five minutes had passed, during which the music was playing, the people around us were having fun, and the two of us sat like two reproductions of the statue of “The Thinker” and exchanged "meaningful" glances.  

"And then?" he asked me at the end.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean what happened afterwards?"

"Well, then a guy called me some mean names for parking behind his garage."

"Aha, and then?"

"And then I go to have dinner with parents, and I try to tell them the story, but have a huge quarrel with my father instead, and I decide I am moving out ASAP!"

"Shit, and then?"

"And then I come here and have this conversation!"

"Rad."

“So, what you think?"

"Yes, this type of stuff happens to me sometimes as well."

He took another sip of vodka and moved closer to me:  

“What do you see in my hand?”  

“A glass of vodka.”  

“How did you know it’s vodka?”  

“Because that’s what you drink.”  

“You’re right, --- He said. "But I asked what you *see*, right?”  

“Okay, I see a glass with transparent liquid.” – I said. – “If I didn’t know you, I’d think it was water. Especially considering the amount...”  
“Absolutely right...” – He interrupted me. – "To assimilate what we see, we liken it to what is most familiar to us, and those are probably the two things we humans know best. -- water and...

He got up from his chair and headed toward the library. The books there weren’t arranged by any principle, but despite that, he immediately found the one he wanted to show me. 

>Note: “Never think you know someone.”

"It was some book on buddhism."

By that time, I was open to accepting new things, but since I was little, I had felt distrust toward religion, bordering on disgust, and the spiritual scriptures seemed to me composed by someone who had taken large amounts of drugs beforehand. But what annoyed me most was the fact that there are people who consider all that to be true. How could Anton be one of those people? 

“Buddhism?” – I said. – “Is that your explanation? I thought you’d pull out some scientific literature, or at least pseudoscientific. Everything is probably better than that.”  

“What do you mean?”  

“Nothing, just to believe....”  

“Little Engineer, listen. You’re a very good friend of mine. That’s why I want to admit to you that sometimes you’re very stupid. No, I expressed myself wrong. You’re not stupid, but you miss things that are very important...”  

“For example?”  

But the Curious One didn’t answer me, because at that moment someone spilled a bottle of red wine on his book.

“You idiot, this book costs over a hundred leva.” – Anton was shouting. – “Not to mention the wine...”  

“I don’t know how it happened...”  

“Well, in the state you’re in, probably someone could pass behind you without you realizing how it happened! Go to the bathroom, get the rag...”  
“Okay. But where is it?”  

“So, there’s a cabinet, which is to your right when you enter. Next to it...”  

I stopped listening to this conversation, trying to come to terms with the fact that on this day, things often interrupted exactly at the moment that was most interesting to me.

“Okay.” – I said to Curious, after the wine crisis was controlled. – “So you believe in god, is that it?”

> Note: “Atheists are allowed to write ‘god’ with a lowercase letter.”

"I don't know, if I believe in god, what's the connection?"

"Book is about god!"

"Nooo..." 

Curious took it to the other part of the room, which was a bit better lighted started listing it and a little later, he handed it to me and pointed to me a passage that was underlined:

>'I together with all living beings, achieved enlightement.'"

“I need to think about that.” -- I took the bottle of vodka, unscrewed the cap, and took a big gulp. “But if we are created by a higher form of life. But then who created that form?”  

“Some even higher one?”  

“And who created *that*?”  

“Considering you’re a mathematician, you probably feel quite uncomfortable with the concept of infinity.” – Curious burst out laughing.  

With this remark, he broke the ice and the conversation between us took off. We started discussing the role of religion through the ages. Little by little, the memory of the Phenomenon began to fade from my head, and even started to seem more pleasant than confusing. I searched for the window, to grasp at the sky. Perhaps the light was there, waiting for me to look at it... But I suddenly remembered that I was at work the next day and how I have decided that I wanted to finally kick off my career, so I could win money, so I could get away from my parents (long chain, of thought for my past 2 o'clock brain).

“Okay, let’s end today’s meeting.” – I said, “I’m going to steal a few hours of sleep before work.” 

While driving, I suddenly remembered what Anton meant when he said that everything was a product of my imagination: “To assimilate what we see, - He had said. -- We liken it to what is most familiar to us. And those are probably the two things we humans know best. -- water and *light*.
